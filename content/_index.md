# Belfry Upkeep

Welcome to *Belfry Upkeep*. This online document, produced by the Central Council Stewardship & Management Workgroup, is aimed at the Steeple Keeper -- the one responsible for keeping the bells in order. You may be an established Steeple Keeper, or one just new to the job, or someone wondering if you should take it on.

Our aims in this document are:

- To help you understand the installation in your tower (they are all different, in detail at least)
- To describe the checks you should carry out to identify any problems
- To advise you on the maintenance tasks that you should be able to carry out, possibly with expert advice or assistance
- Most importantly, to help you recognise the tasks that require specialist knowledge from a Bell Hanger or other expert
