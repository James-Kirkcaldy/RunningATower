# Health & Safety

Further details can be found at Guidance notes - health and safety policy advice. 

These must be in-line with the Tower authority’s policies. 

This includes guidance on: 

- Risk Assessments. 

- Fire precautions, further details can be found at Guidance notes - fire prevention. 

- Fire safety. 

- First aid. 

- Electrical power, lighting and emergency lighting. 

- Accidents and illness. 

- Advice for visitors, both ringers and non-ringers. 

Consideration should be given to special occasions such as tower open days when large numbers of people may be present. 

Special events probably need a completely separate section 

Ringing is safe until you forget it is dangerous. Your first responsibility, as the person in charge, is the safety of the ringers.  

- If a novice ringer is normally able to handle a bell but still sometimes gets into trouble, nominate an experienced ringer to stand close by to intervene if necessary. 

- Observe how any unknown visitor, who says they can ring, catches hold and if it looks wrong ask them to ring the bell on their own first and stand near in case you need to intervene. 

- Invite any nervous ringers and especially nervous visitors to ring the bell solo a couple of times first.  

- If you see any signs of physical distress, especially in older ringers, call ‘Stand’ at once. 

- Call ‘Stand’ if there is any significant loss of bell control or other incident.  

- Don’t investigate any worrying noises or strange rope movements before any bells, that need to be, are rung down. If you don’t know the frame layout and relationship to the entry into the bell-chamber ring all the bells down before investigating. If in any doubt ring the bells down and curtail the session. There is always another session; there is not always a way back from a serious accident. N.B Take particular care if a clapper fails, this may break the slider, if they are present in the installation (Hasting stays do not have a slider). Do not try to stand the bell – ring it down with care.  

## Attendance Record(s) 

These should be maintained for the purposes of safeguarding and for emergency precautions. The details to be held should be a minimum of name, entrance and exit date and times. The tower authority may require further details to be logged. 

Towers may wish to have a separate (traditional) visitors' book as an historic record. 

## Additional requirements 

The tower authority may have other requirements and these should be discussed with the authorities. These may arise from insurance or other reasons. 

Special precautions may need to be put in place from time to time e.g., the requirements put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic. The CCCBR website details the latest guidance in these cases. 

## First Aid Kit

*Figure 1: Readily available first aid kit*

Ideally there should be a first aid kit in the ringing chamber.  

Ensure the location is indicated especially if it is elsewhere within the premises. 

Regularly check that all items remain within date.  

## Insurance 

In the Church of England, ringers are normally included as voluntary workers in the church policy, as long as they have permission to ring. It is probably worth checking what the cover is if there is any doubt. Do not expect a massive pay-out for a cut finger! 

Further details can be found at Guidance notes - insurance 

## Security 

Further details can be found at Guidance notes - security for ringers 

A limited number of keys to the building (and internal doors) may be held by the ringers. A single key for each lock is inadvisable, as this will present difficulties at times of sickness or absence. All keys should be registered with the tower authority. This may be a condition of the building insurance.

## Tower Access 

Guidance notes - Tower Access and Stairways (link to existing CCCBR documentation) 

Consider the number of keys and/or key holders. There is a balance between security (preventing access) but enabling reasonable access. Emergency exits must never be compromised. 

Spider, ropes should, ideally, be left inaccessible e.g. locked away. This is essential in accessible ringing chambers.  

Bells should not be left up between ringing sessions especially where access to the bell and ringing chambers are not properly secured.  

Turning clappers when bells are up should be avoided in all but exceptional cases such as on heavy bells that are extremely difficult / impossible to rise right-sided. 

There needs to be much more guidance on this e.g. –when it can be done / not done. Look at the EIG (Ecclesiastical Insurance) guidance on this – their document may be modified following a discussion with them.

## Other Tower Users

There may be other users of the tower and its internal spaces. These, their access and usage requirements will need consideration. Users may include clock winder(s), flag raiser(s), flower arrangers, creches. Also, clergy and choirs are often users and conflict at the same times as ringers.  

Consideration also needs to be given to visitors on open days and the general public, especially in ground floor installations. 

There may also be persons requiring access to other installations (such as mobile telephone equipment housed in the tower).
