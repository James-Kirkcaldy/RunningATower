# Glossary

As with any technical subject, bell ringing and bell hanging has, over the years, developed specialist terms some of which are unique to ringing and others which have particular meaning when applied to ringing. Some other technical terms may not be familiar to ringers. We hope to have included all of these here. They are linked from the text in the various chapters. Items appearing elsewhere in the glossary are shown in **Bold**.

## ART - Association of Ringing Teachers

Organisation involved with all aspects of teaching ringing. Further details on their **[website](https://ringingteachers.org/)**.

## Authority 

The legal term for this is “Controller of Premisses”, it doesn’t matter who specifically, but this could be the PCC, Dean and Chapter, a charitable group, or an individual who is legally responsible for the building. Technically it is incumbent on the Controller of Premises to ensure all regulations are compiled with, but they should also support the ringers if things are not available.

## CCCBR - Central Council of Church Bell Ringers

The Council is the representative body for all who ring bells in the English tradition with rope and wheel. Founded in 1891, the Council today represents 65 affiliated societies, which cover all parts of the British Isles as well as centres of ringing in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the USA, South Africa and Italy. These societies in turn comprise the members of the local companies of ringers in their areas.
