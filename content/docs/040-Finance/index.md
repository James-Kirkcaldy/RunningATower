## Income  

### Weddings 

In the Church of England, the fees for wedding ringing are set by the ***[PCC](../170-glossary/#PCC)***, hopefully in consultation with the ringers. These should reflect whether ringing is: 

- Before and / or after the wedding. 

- The length of time spent ringing. 

- The number of bells to be rung. Some towers charge proportionately.

- Likely travel times and distances, etc. 

The couple should be advised that if the bride arrives excessively late, ringing may not continue until her arrival and may be curtailed after the service. Consider setting an end time when ringing will finish by, particularly for ringing after a wedding. This gives certainty of the time when ringers can get away and helps get a band. This is useful to help co-ordinate when ringers are required at a few local churches on the same day. 

## Fees for other ringing 

Consider having fixed fees for: 

- Visiting bands

- Funerals, possibly fee commensurate with that for weddings.

- Quarter peals 

- Peals 

These may be determined in consultation with the tower ***[authority](../170-glossary/#authority)***. If there are no fixed fees it is not unusual to expect voluntary donations from visiting bands and individuals.

Avoid having a 'box on the wall', especially for downstairs rings, as these will invite theft and damage. 

![Electronic donation](donate_350.jpg)

Consider having an electronic payment system for fees and casual donations. These may involve a commission charge which, although low, reduces the donation received. Implementing this should involve the ***[PCC](../170-glossary/#PCC)*** and its treasurer, within a church setting, which may allow gift aid to be recovered and ensure that payments for ringing can be captured in an appropriate account. N.B. Request for Gift Aid, enabling tax to be reclaimed, only applies to charities and HMRC registered charitable groups.

## Payment of Fees 

Arrangements must also be made for how the ringers receive any payments. In the Church of England, it is likely that the couple pay the church the whole cost at one time. The church then arranges the transfer of money to the recipient groups. With the reduction in use of cash, the church may expect to do this via bank transfer. 

## Subscriptions

The tower and / or the local society may charge a subscription, thypically this is an amount payable annually.

## Expenditure 

Agree with the tower ***[authority](../170-glossary/#authority)*** and agree in advance who will pay for replaceable items e.g., ropes. In the Church of England, it may be worth running more of the tower funds through the PCC (registered charity and registered with HMRC for Gift Aid). For example, a £600 inc VAT invoice, paid by the church can reduce the cost to a (tax paying) donor to £400. That is a reduction of a third by using the two schemes (Gift Aid and LPWS (Listed Place of Worship Scheme)) together. This is a big encouragement to use the PCC funds over any tower fund. The LPWS (at present day) covers all bell fittings, bells, bell ropes and muffles.

If a major project is envisaged the funding of this must be agreed in consultation with the tower ***[authority](../170-glossary/#authority)***. A separate [document](https://cccbr.org.uk/major-projects/) covers the running of a project.

## Tower Funds 

In the Church of England, funds are best held within the ***[PCC](../170-glossary/#PCC)*** accounts. Ideally these should be ring-fenced so as to prevent their use for non-ringing related expenditure. This is achieved by having a covering document listing the restrictions of the funds. If ring-fenced there has to be a means of amending the restrictions, a definition of who can do this is essential.
If a tower has funds, separate from the tower ***[authority](../170-glossary/#authority)***, these should never be held by an individual. These, traditionally, have been used for minor repairs and social events for ringers. Such funds are not advisable.  If essential, specific treasurer’s accounts are available and may be free from fees. Banks are increasingly reluctant to having small society accounts.

## VAT and the LPW (Listed Places of Worship) VAT recovery scheme 

This allows VAT on eligible expenditure to be reclaimed where the church is listed. The eligible expenditure is very vague when it comes to bells, but generally covers bells, bell frames, bell fittings (probably stays), ropes, muffles and training bells. It is highly probable that most things ringing related that keep the hardware going are likely to be eligible, but it is worth checking as the scheme does change. Further details are available on the [LPW scheme website](http://www.lpwscheme.org.uk/). Also, a claim, with multiple invoices below the £1000 threshold, can be made once per year. This means one can claim £10 back on a £60 (including VAT) invoice - it is not a difficult process.
