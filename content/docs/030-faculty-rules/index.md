# Faculty Jurisdiction Rules

![Leonard Stanley, Gloucestershire](faculty-rules-title.jpg)

{{<hint danger>}}
This chapter refers to activities carried out in churches within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. Ringers must remember that the Rules are set out in law, with possible penalties if they are not followed. Meeting the Rules is the responsibility of the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council, and ringers must use their specialist knowledge to assist the Church authorities in any application. Guidance should be sought from the Diocesan Secretary, The Diocesan Bell Advisor, and the local Guild or Association.

Ringers are probably aware that a Faculty may be required prior to work being done in a Church of England Church. The faculty process exempts churches from listed building consent and conservation area consent that could apply elsewhere. When alterations are proposed, the parish must present the proposals to the archdeacon. For minor alterations, the archdeacon may authorise the work but more major projects will be judged by the Chancellor of the diocese, taking advice from specialists in the [***Diocesan Advisory Committee***](../170-glossary/#diocesan-advisory-committee-dac). The faculty is the legal authorisation of the work by the Chancellor.  

The faculty system is a judicial system, so these notes reflect this style. Parishes and ringers intending do any work in their tower or on their bells must consider the full implications of the Rules.

## Background 

The Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015 were introduced with the intention of simplifying the faculty process and reducing the burden of administration, in particular for churchwardens and others in parishes with responsibility for church buildings. The major innovation of the 2015 Rules was the introduction of Lists A and B for items that could be undertaken without a faculty, subject to some general conditions stipulated in the Schedule. 
-	Items in List A may be undertaken by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation. 
-	Items in List B may be undertaken without a faculty provided the archdeacon is consulted and has given written authorisation.

The Rules were amended in 2019 and again in 2022. The full version of the latest guidance is [here](https://www.churchofengland.org/resources/churchcare/church-buildings-council/how-we-manage-our-buildings).

## Items Most Likely to be of Relevance for Ringers

The extracts given below are relevant to bells and associated fittings, and also to clocks. Church clocks are included here because they are typically housed in the church tower and in many cases use the ringing bells as clock bells.

### List A:
 As stated above, items in List A may simply be undertaken (within the specified conditions) by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation. The Steeple Keeper will work closely with the parish in discussions on these.
