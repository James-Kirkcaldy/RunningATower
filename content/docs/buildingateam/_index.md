## Administration

### Annual Meeting

Hold a meeting when all officers are appointed from within the band. These may be subject to confirmation with the ***[tower authority](../170-glossary/#authority)***. Consider whether a maximum length of tenure of the offices may be appropriate. The simplest manner is to consider all offices resigned at the annual meeting. Consider having a maximum term of office. Ideally, meetings should be held annually. Others may be held as required.
The agenda should be distributed in advance together with a request for items to be included in any other business. The idea of an agenda is to keep a meeting on track. 

The person chairing the meeting should be aware of the focus of the meeting and not allow digression. They should also be aware of the anticipated timescale and keep to this. 
The chair may not be one of the ringers. In a religious institution the incumbent is a good choice. A church warden or chair of the ***[PCC](../170-glossary/#pcc)*** may also be an appropriate choice. In a tower within a non-religious setting, a representative of the ***[tower authority](../170-glossary/#authority)*** would be a good choice. Such examples offer impartiality and enables them to meet the ringers and hear about the activities of the ringers.

### Appointment of Officers

Further details can be found at [Guidance notes - appointment of tower captain](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SM_Appt_of_TowerCaptain_2020_Ver_1.pdf). Any appointment should be made in agreement with the ***[tower authority](../170-glossary/#authority)***. The officers are there to run the tower, provide points of contact and to relieve the pressure on one individual. The potential roles may include:

{{<hint info>}}
 - Tower Captain. Overall responsibility.
 - Ringing Master. Runs the ringing.
 - Secretary. Looks after the administration.
 - Treasurer. Looks after the funds and expenditure.
 - Steeple Keeper. Looks after the installation.
 - Social Secretary. Looks after the non-ringing events.
{{</hint>}}

If there are a number of ringers attached to the tower, it is a good idea to engage as many members as possible. There are plenty of roles which may be used e.g., Deputy, Secretary, Steeple Keeper, Instructor, Conductor, Librarian.  Roles, especially deputy, instructor and conductor should not undermine the authority of the tower captain or raise expectations of future election to tower captain


### Bell Fund

If tower funds are held in a PCC restricted bell fund, that should be reviewed. The bellringers (not the PCC) should have the ability to amend the restrictions at the AGM by a majority vote.

### Calendar

Maintain a calendar which is publicised to all, including the ***[tower authority](../170-glossary/#authority)***. This may be printed or held by some electronic means. The calendar should list:

{{<hint info>}}
-	The weekly, monthly schedule.
-	Annual dates e.g. ringers’ dinner, tower outing(s), AGM
-	Special events e.g. particular Saint’s days, (church) patronal festival, fetes 
-	Public Open days, e.g. heritage open days.
- Training days, teaching sessions when not a practice night.
{{</hint>}}

Consider when to ring and when not to ring. 
Occasions to ring include Sunday services, weddings, funerals, church events, national events, patronal day, local festivals and traditions. It is worth compiling a list for your tower. 
Occasions not to ring may include Holy Week, see the “Ringing Forums” [discussion](https://www.ringingforums.org/discussion/93/ringing-in-holy-week-time-to-spring-clean-the-tower-but-what-ringing-for-a-funeral) on this.

There are proprietary apps available that might be of use in arranging a calendar, e.g. WhatsApp, Band.

### Arranging Ringing

The [CCCBR Volunteering and Leadership Work Group](https://cccbr.org.uk/about/workgroups/volunteer-and-leadership/) is the primary source of information for this topic. Further details as to what help they can provide can be obtained by selecting the 'what we do' link on that webpage.

If you are not used to running ringing, doing so can seem daunting. There is no need for it to be, in essence it is simple. You are going to ask certain ringers to try and ring certain things. This means you have to judge who can ring what and what they will find useful or, ideally and, enjoy. No one gets that right all the time. With practice you will get better at it. 

Perhaps the most important things to remember are:
-	Ringers are volunteers. They are at the practice because they want to be.
-	Ringers are human. They have good days and bad days. What they can ring well one week they might struggle with the next.
-	Ringing is a team activity. How well we ring and how much pleasure we get from it depends on how well the band rings; not just on how well the individual rings.

The following are a series of tips to running ringing. Not all will be applicable to you and the ringing that you are running. You do not need to remember, let alone master, them all when you start. You will discover which work in your unique circumstances. There is no standard tower nor standard ringing session. With that in mind here are some tips.

### Know your ringers

This is not always possible if there are visitors. Generally you need to be aware:
- Why your ringers come to a ringing session.
- What their skill level is.
- At a practice what, if anything, they want to improve on. 
- If there are visitors you don’t know then ask them if and what they can ring. Suggest some rounds for them to ‘get a feel of the bells’. When they ring, judge for yourself how accurate their statements were.

### Purpose

Decide what you want to achieve, both as a band and for individuals. If you can, publicise what is to be rung and why, a few days before each session. As far as attendance and performance allows, try and ring what was advertised. If you were unable to ring what you said, briefly explain why at the end of the session. Remember the ringers are volunteers, the degree to which you can structure a session will vary with the band and with individuals. Some ringers may come to sessions mainly to get out of the house and socialise as part of a group. They may well be happy to get better at ringing, but it may not be a prime consideration. On the other hand, some may want to progress their ringing more. Having some, if only loose, structure to a session should help keep more people happy as they can see there is something in it for them.

### Recruitment and maintaining a band

Further details can be found at [Guidance notes - recruitment and retention](https://cccbr.org.uk/resources/recruitment-and-retention/workshop/).

There are resources available in the [CCCBR Publicity material resources](https://cccbr.org.uk/resources/publicity-material/). These include the following:
- Recruitment Leaflet - designed for distribution to the general public. Printed copies are available on request.
- Tower Open Day poster - to be used for promotion of such.
- Porch Notice - display essential information about ringing at the tower.
- Engaging with the Public - useful information for engaging the public with ringing and any ringing-related activity taking place.
Publicity Flyer: ‘Bell Ringing is fun and …’ - This leaflet was produced by Sue Hall, originally for the Derby Diocesan Association. It is downloadable and customisable.

Other Central Council guidance is available:
- [Social media](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/200902-Social_Media_Guidance.pdf).
- [Running a successful open day](https://cccbr.org.uk/running-a-successful-tower-open-day-v6/).

Teaching and developing visiting other towers, striking competitions, special practices.

The ***[Association of Ringing Teachers](../170-glossary/#art)*** provides a structured set of [guidelines](http://ringingteachers.org/resources/recruitment-and-retention).

### Safeguarding

See information contained at ***[Formalities - Safeguarding](../030-formalities/#Disclosure)***.

### Safety 

See information contained in [Health & Safety](../050-healthsafety).

### Subscriptions

These may be required for the individual tower, the local society.
There may be others, such as a tower subscription to The Ringing World. 

### Visitors

Is there an agreed policy for the number of visiting bands, how long such ringing should last and any special considerations around timings. The latter may particularly apply when the bells are intrusive.
It is to be hoped that visiting bands try to perform well. 

The Guild of Clerical Ringers have produced a [document](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021_05_08_GCR_FAQstoCCCBR.pdf) that covers some of these topics from more of a clergy point of view.
