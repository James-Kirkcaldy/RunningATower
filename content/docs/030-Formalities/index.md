# Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Checks 

In the Church of England, the Tower Captain and anyone teaching within the tower, must have an up-to-date check. All certification must be kept up to date. This check is normally obtained through the safeguarding officer of the relevant church. 

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 

Any records of ringers must be in-line with statutory regulations and any requirements of the tower authority.  

Permission must be obtained from parents / guardians of under 18s.  

Membership list and contact details should be kept secure. Access should be restricted to a defined list of officers. Parental details must be held for under 18s, with date of birth to indicate when a minor becomes an adult.  

Further details can be found at Guidance notes - General Data Protection Regulation 

# Safeguarding 

Further details can be found by at Guidance notes - safeguarding. 

In a Church of England setting, the Tower Captain, and other persons with responsibilities, should have completed the Safeguarding Leadership training module. It would be expected that the remainder of the band should have completed the Basic and Foundation Safeguarding training modules.  

The required levels must always be in line with the tower authority’s policies.   

All certification must be kept up to date. 

Teaching with only a tutor and a pupil present should be avoided. This may not apply when both are members of the same immediate family.  

What about travel with under 18s? 

Need parental consent for under 18s and parent / guardian present.  

Example forms? 

Be aware of the guidelines and follow them. If there are children, young persons or vulnerable adults arriving for a session, and the appropriate number of enhanced DBS cleared and other adults don’t turn up, cancel the session or ask the children, young persons or vulnerable adults to leave as soon as they can be safely escorted. A ringing room with a fair number of observing adults in it is an unlikely setting for abuse to take place and as the leader running the session you will quickly stamp on any bullying or unnecessary touching. Just be aware of any apparent friendships developing between adults and children, young persons or vulnerable adults that could lead to grooming taking place outside the ringing setting. If anything gives you cause for concern discuss it with your parish safeguarding officer.
