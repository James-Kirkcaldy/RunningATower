## Liaison with relevant authority 

![Heavitree, Devon](heavitree_350.jpg)

The term ***[tower authority](../glossary/#authority)*** is used to mean the owner(s) and / or person(s) responsible for the bells and the tower in which they are installed. About 90% of rings of bells, hung for full circle change ringing, are in buildings forming part of the ***[C of E](../glossary/#c-of-e)***. In these cases, the legal ownership of the bells is vested in the Churchwardens. The ***[PCC](../glossary/#pcc)*** has a duty for the use, maintenance and insurance of the bells. It is recommended to have a ringing representative on the PCC.

Elsewhere, for example in ***[C of E](../glossary/#c-of-e)*** cathedrals, churches of other denominations and other religious buildings worldwide, there are likely to be different lines of authority. 

![Mobile Belfry 2 at CCCBR, Nottingham](Mobile2_350.jpg)

***[Tower authority](../glossary/#authority)*** also means those owning and / or responsible for rings of bells that are mobile or in secular buildings – e.g. the Local Authority for a municipal ring of bells, or a private owner. 

## Faculties 

These are applicable to the ***[C of E](../glossary/#c-of-e)***. Guidance notes on these should be consulted for any proposed changes within the tower. Futher information can be found at [changes to the faculty process](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SM_Faculty_Changes_2022_Ver_3.pdf).

## Contact Details 

![CCCBR Porch Notice](porch_350.jpg)

It is useful to display contact details such that they are visible when the building is not open. If regular ringing takes place, include the relevant times. Contact details may be name(s), telephone number(s) and / or e-mail address(es). Whenever contact details are publicised consider: 

- Personal details should be anonymised and GDPR compliant. Use only the details that the contact is prepared to publicise. The contact must give permission. It is better to give the name of their office and not a personal name.

- Use a generic e-mail address e.g., “Tower Name-Bells @ domain name" instead of a personal e-mail address. This also allows the address to be passed on, should the contact change.

- Provide a mobile telephone number rather than a landline telephone number. The individual may be travelling to the church when contact is attempted, especially when close to a ringing session.

- Keep up to date – review at least annually e.g. at AGM.

## Societies 

![Badges of ringing societies](badges_350.jpg)

The tower may be affiliated to a local ringing society. That body may have the title of Association, Guild, Society, etc. The term society will be used in this document. It may cover the local area, county, diocese or country. A tower does not have to be a member of the local society, however there may be advantages to being a member, these may include: 

- Access to training and development. 

- Access to expertise in tower and belfry inspection. 

- Insurance. 

- Ringing and social meetings, presenting opportunities to meet other ringers with similar experience and age group, this is considered especially important for younger ringers. 

- Ringing at other towers and experiencing different number and weights of bells.

- Opportunities to progress an individual's ringing expertise. This may be achieved by the opportunity to ring quarter peals and peals with more experienced ringers.

- Providing a “mentor” to support the development of individuals and of the band.

- Taking committee positions – this can help develop individuals. Young people could gain experience for future careers. 

- Societies often have influence with the relevant ***[tower authority](../glossary/#authority)***.

Most societies are affiliated to the ***[CCCBR](../glossary/#cccbr)***. 

## Promotion 

![CCCBR recruitment leaflet](recruitment_350.jpg)

Consider the use of: 

- Posters outside, or inside, the building. Ensure that these are kept up to date, especially any contact details. There are [publicity materials](https://cccbr.org.uk/resources/publicity-material/) on the CCCBR website, this includes downloadable templates.

- Flags, banners and publicity stands. These may be available from a local society.  

- Publicity away from the building, especially where the building is not on a main thoroughfare. 

- Regular updates in the parish magazine, local press, radio, television and social media. There is a useful [document](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Press-Info.pdf) on engaging with the press on the CCCBR website.  

The ***[CCCBR](../glossary/#cccbr)*** also provides [guidance on the use of social media](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/200902-Social_Media_Guidance.pdf).

Publicise events when these are not a regular occurrence e.g., striking competitions, ringing for special events. Consider placing these in the parish magazine, on the building website and the building social media account. If extended ringing is to take place, consider posting flyers in the vicinity and through letter boxes of properties within earshot. Be aware that this may lead to strong opposers attempting to get retailation in first.

For major projects such as the restoration of an installation, including augmentation, separate publicity will be required. This is covered in a separate document [Running a Project](https://cccbr.org.uk/major-projects/).
