# Formalities 

## Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Checks 

In the ***[C of E](../170-glossary/#CofE)***, the Tower Captain and anyone teaching within the tower, must have an up-to-date check. All certification must be kept up to date. This check is normally obtained through the safeguarding officer of the relevant church. Details of the DBS service is available on their [website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service).

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 

Any records of ringers must be in-line with statutory regulations and any requirements of the tower authority.  

Permission must be obtained from parents / guardians of under 18s.  

Membership list and contact details should be kept secure. Access should be restricted to a defined list of officers. Parental details must be held for under 18s, with date of birth to indicate when a minor becomes an adult.  

Further details can be found at [General Data Protection Regulation](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GDPR-Chris-Mew.pdf)

## Safeguarding 

Further details can be found at [safeguarding](https://cccbr.org.uk/safeguarding/). 

In a ***[C of E](../170-glossary/#CofE)*** setting, the Tower Captain, and other persons with responsibilities, should have completed the Safeguarding Leadership training module. It would be expected that the remainder of the band should have completed the Basic and Foundation Safeguarding training modules.  

The required levels must always be in line with the tower authority’s policies.   

All certification must be kept up to date. 

Teaching with only a tutor and a pupil present should be avoided. This may not apply when both are members of the same immediate family.  

When under 18s take place in ringing and reingign rleated activities, including travelling parental consent must be obtained or the parent / guardian must be presentpresent.  

Be aware of the guidelines and follow them. If there are children, young persons or vulnerable adults arriving for a session, and the appropriate number of enhanced DBS cleared and other adults don’t turn up, cancel the session or ask the children, young persons or vulnerable adults to leave as soon as they can be safely escorted. A ringing room with a fair number of observing adults in it is an unlikely setting for abuse to take place. The leader running the session must quickly stamp on any bullying or unnecessary touching. The leader should be aware of any apparent friendships developing between adults and children, young persons or vulnerable adults that could lead to grooming taking place outside the ringing setting. If anything gives cause for concern, it must be discussed with the relevant safeguarding officer (parishes should have one in post).
