# Building a Tower – Planning ringing

## Timing  

If you have to raise and lower the bells at the start and end of the session it will take about 15 mins out of the time. This won’t be all ringing time. At the start, some ringers will not arrive exactly on time, then there is the saying hello, hanging up coats, etc. There will be similar process at the end of the session. If your session is ninety mins long, you now have seventy-five mins to achieve your aims and hopefully give everyone at least one piece of useful and satisfy ringing. It takes four to five minutes to ring, say one hundred and twenty changes of Doubles or Minor. On eight, or more, bells plain courses and touches will tend to be a bit longer. Four to five minutes is also a reasonable period to time to ring some rounds or call changes. Allowing for a two-to-three-minute change over period between each piece of ringing will use up about seven to eight minutes. Seven and a half minutes gives 10 pieces of ringing between raising and lowering the bells. In practice it will often be nine or less. Nine pieces of ringing is a good planning assumption. 

## Plan ahead - Place the band 

At first this can seem overly officious and you may need to explain to your ringers why you are doing it. Ideally do any explaining in the margins of ringing rather than during a session. 

The primary purpose of placing a band during a session, as opposed to a quarter peal or peal, is to make sure that the ringers you want to practice something do so with the best possible chance of success. For instance, if there is more than one less able ringer in the band you do not want them on adjacent (coursing) bells. Hopefully it also allows you to ensure that rest of the band is sufficiently competent to give the improving ringers the support they need. For the best chance of success and better striking, the generally accepted method is to place the band from the extremes inwards starting with the tenor and then for odd-bell methods on even numbers of bells the heaviest working bell. i.e., for Doubles in a six-bell tower the 5th. Next comes the treble. For methods, as opposed to principles, the treble provides the framework around which the method is constructed. If an inside bell goes wrong the rest of the ringers can normally cope and there is a fair change of putting things right. If the treble goes wrong, it affects all the other ringers. Also note that because the difference in swing speeds is most pronounced between tenor and treble, striking these bells well requires more reliance of listening and rhythm than the middle bells do. Good ringers will not object to ringing the treble, indeed they will often rightly regard being asked to as a complement. 

During a session you may well want a ringer to practice plain hunting to a method, which will place that ringer on the treble. Ideally the rest of the band needs to be able to ring with an unreliable treble. Combining an inexperienced treble ringer with an inexperienced inside ringer rarely ends well. Also, you may well wish to give a ringer experience on a different bell which will mitigate against the ideal for success and striking. So, placing a band during a session will often be a compromise between the best for good ringing and what you are trying to achieve. 

The secondary purpose of placing a band is to speed up the session and maybe get some more ‘rings’ in. Placing bands cuts out the delay caused by ringers hanging back when ringers are asked to ‘catch-hold for …’, it pre-empts you having to remove that ringer who thinks they can ring it from the band, and it overcomes the hesitancy of your better ringers not to ring too often as they don’t want to appear greedy. If when announcing what is to be ring next you can also announce what follows together with the bells the ‘target’ ringers are to ring that will also speed things up. (Note, for some bands speeding things up may be a bad idea, they may be there as much for social as ringing reasons. Assuming you are aiming to improve the ringing, you may need to nudge them gently in this direction; not go full throttle into fast paced sessions.) 

## Nominate the conductor 

Nominate a competent conductor if a piece of ringing is primarily for the benefit of other less able ringers. If the purpose is to give a ringer conducting practice, then give them a competent band, at least to start with. Less able ringers’ confidence will be damaged if something is miscalled, they may blame themselves. The learner conductor’s confidence will be damaged if they cannot know where to put calls because bells are in the wrong place, particularly if the treble is in the wrong place. 

Example announcement of next piece of ringing “Rounds and Call changes next. {Target ringer A} please ring the 3rd and {Target ringer B} please ring the 5th. Fred, please call them from the 4th. Ann ring the tenor, Bill the treble and Cath the 2nd please. After this we will ring Plain Bob Doubles for {Target ringer C} and I will call it.” 

## Summary 

Some, maybe all, of the tips above may seem totally unrealistic in your tower. You will need to use your leadership skills to assess both the attitude and ability of your ringers. This will determine how much you can structure the session and how hard you can push them. Unless you have very good sound control or have simulators on all bells, your session is a very public affair. The quality of the ringing says something about the church you ring at. Try to encourage the pursuit of good ringing in your ringers, noting that good ringing does not need to be advanced ringing. Applying aspects of the advice above should help. 

- To get the most out of the time available you need to plan at least one piece of ringing ahead, ideally two. This will reduce the gaps between pieces of ringing allowing more of the time to be used for ringing. You need to know what is going to be rung next and for whose primary benefit. The ringers will benefit from knowing what is coming next so they can mentally rehearse or even look up things while they are sitting out.  There are two techniques to keep it simple and for deciding and keeping track of what is to be rung. If you regularly run sessions to a pattern, the other ringers start to follow the pattern and can see when they are likely to get a chance to ring what they need to practice. Try and avoid the trap where the ‘good’ ringer’ only come at the end of the practice for the ‘good/advanced ringing’. Assess what the least and most advanced levels of ringing that there is value in performing. If a practice session, there is little point practicing what all the ringers present have mastered. There is no point in trying to ring what you have not got enough ringers for, at minimum that’s enough who are competent to support the one or two for whom this a sensible next step in their ringing. 

- Triage the ringers by ability. Ringers' abilities and experience vary. You need some way of arranging the ringing so that everyone gets something out of the session. Roughly assign the ringers to a least, middling and higher ability group. Be prepared to adjust this as the session proceeds, we all have good days and bad days. 

- Sequence the pieces of ringing to provide opportunities for the ringers, from the three groups, in turn. If you have enough ringers who should be sound at the level to be rung, have only one or two ringers for whom it will represent progress - the target ringers for that piece. Aim to start with the simplest ringing needed for the least able group and end with the most advanced that the higher ability group should be able to ring well. The aim is to end on a high point, one that hopefully allows the less able to hear what better ringing sounds like. 

For a ninety-minute practice session, you now have a basic 11 pieces of ringing template. 

- Ring up, in peal if you can 

- Simplest for some members of least able group 

- Relatively simple for middle ability group 

- Relatively simple for higher ability group 

- Least able group piece 

- Middle ability group piece 

- Challenging higher ability group piece (remember you are aiming for a well struck higher ability group piece to end with) 

- Least able group piece 

- Middle ability group piece 

- Low risk higher ability group piece 

- Ring down, in peal if you can 

Note this is a template not a rigid plan. You will have to adjust as the session proceeds. You may not have enough ringers to divide into three or even two ability groups. There may not be a low-risk option for that final well struck piece of ringing. You might even want to practice ringing up and down in peal more than once! 

What matters is to know what is going to be rung next and to some extent who is going to ring it. This will cut out dithering between ringing over what to ring and give you and ringers confidence that you are proactively running the session. Announcing what is coming after the next piece of ringing will speed up the changeover between pieces of ringing, as well as providing the mental rehearsal time mentioned above.
