About 90% of rings of bells, hung for full circle change ringing, are in buildings forming part of the Church of England. In these cases, the legal ownership of the bells is vested in the Churchwardens. The PCC has a duty for the use, maintenance and insurance of the bells. It is recommended to have a ringing representative on the PCC. The representative can act as an additional liaison, advising on how ringing is carried out and involving the ringers in important decisions (especially those that may affect ringing).\nFigure 2: Exeter Cathedral, Devon\nElsewhere, for example in Church of England cathedrals, churches of other denominations and other religious buildings worldwide, there are likely to be different lines of authority.\nFigure 3: Mobile Belfry 2 at CCCBR Roadshow, September 2022\nTower authority also means those owning and / or responsible for rings of bells that are mobile or in secular buildings – e.g. the Local Authority for a municipal ring of bells, or a private owner.\nThe CCCBR produce a number of leaflets:\nFrom Practice to Perfect that is aimed at clergy, PCCs and safeguarding advisors. This guide explains how ringers are trained, safeguarded and organised.\nA book entitled \u0026lsquo;The Voice of the Church: Bells and bellringers in the life of the Church of England\u0026rsquo; is available from The Ringing World. It might be worth considering purchasing a copy and giving it to the incumbent.\nBells in your care contains notes for incumbents and churchwardens who find themselves responsible for a ring of church bells.\nFrequently asked questions contains a number of questions put together, in 2020, by the Guild of Clerical Ringers. It was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nAlthough not directly related to ringing, the Church of England produce a set of church stewardship resources.\nFaculties # These are applicable to bells and towers within the Church of England. Guidance notes on these should be consulted for any proposed changes within a tower. Further information can be found at Belfry Upkeep Faculty Rules.\nContact Details # Figure 4: CCCBR sourced notice\nIt is useful to display contact details such that they are visible when the building is not open. If regular ringing takes place, include the relevant times. Contact details may be name(s), telephone number(s) and / or e-mail address(es). Whenever contact details are publicised consider:\nPersonal details should be anonymised and GDPR compliant. Use only the details that the contact is prepared to publicise. The contact must give permission. It is better to give the name of their office and not a personal name.\nUse a generic e-mail address e.g., “Tower Name-Bells @ domain name\u0026quot; instead of a personal e-mail address. This anonymises the individual and allows the address to be passed on, should the contact change.\nProvide a mobile telephone number rather than a landline telephone number. The individual may be travelling to the church when contact is attempted, especially when close to a ringing session.\nKeep up to date – review at least annually e.g. at the tower AGM.\nThe CCCBR have published a number of notices, intended for notice boards, they can be accessed (and downloaded) from here.\nRinging Societies # Figure 5: Sample of ringing society badges\nThe body may have the title of Association, Guild, Society, etc. The term ringing society will be used in this document. The ringing society may cover the local area, county, diocese or country. A ringing society would normally have individual ringers as members. It may be that the society has an affiliate membership for other bodies e.g. PCC.\nThere may be advantages to membership of a ringing society such as:\nAccess to training and development.\nAccess to expertise in tower and belfry inspection.\nInsurance.\nRinging and social meetings, presenting opportunities to meet other ringers with similar experience and age group, this is considered especially important for younger ringers.\nRinging at other towers and experiencing different numbers and weights of bells.\nOpportunities to progress an individual\u0026rsquo;s ringing expertise. This may be achieved by the opportunity to ring quarter peals and peals with more experienced ringers.\nProviding a “mentor” to support the development of individuals and of the band.\nTaking committee positions which may help develop individuals. Young people may gain experience for future careers.\nRinging societies often have influence with the relevant tower authority.\nMost ringing societies are affiliated to the CCCBR.\nPromotion # Figure 6: CCCBR sourced recruitment leaflet\nConsider the use of:\nPosters outside, or inside, the building. Ensure that these are kept up to date, especially contact details. Publicity materials are available on the CCCBR website, this includes downloadable templates.\nFlags, banners and publicity stands. These may be available from a local ringing society.\nPublicity away from the building, especially where the building is not on a main thoroughfare.\nRegular updates in the parish magazine, local press, radio, television and social media. A document on engaging with the press and a document on guidance on the use of social media are available on the CCCBR website.\nPublicise events when these are not a regular occurrence e.g., striking competitions, ringing for special events. Consider placing these in the parish magazine, on the building website and the building social media account. If extended ringing is to take place, consider posting flyers in the vicinity and through letter boxes of properties within earshot. Be aware that this may lead to strong opposers attempting to get their retailation in first.\nFor major projects such as the restoration of an installation, including augmentation, separate publicity will be required. This is covered in a separate document currently under development.\nProperty sales and / or change of use near a church # Ringers may be concerned when property near a church with bells is to be sold or developed for new uses. The concern is that new occupants may not like the sound of the bells and raise complaints.\nFor property sales, the formal local authority searches should indicate activities that may affect the property concerned. It is therefore worthwhile for ringers (through the church incumbent) to advise the estate agents of ringing times. Include factual information about normal ringing schedules (services and practices) plus the likely occurrence of additional ringing such as weddings, funerals, visitors, quarter peals and peals, plus special events such as local and national celebrations.\nWhere there are changes of use proposed for properties close to a tower, then the local authority planning department should be made aware of the church bells by the incumbent at an early stage in the planning process. Again, including a summary of the ringing activities will help planners. Developers may be required to mitigate the impact of the bells on the new users in the development.\nThe church and ringers should also consider the noise levels from the bells and whether sound control measures in the tower are adequate or could be improved. Complaints about church bells often mean the clock bells rather more than change ringing, so consider silencing the clock at night (automatically).\nThere are various articles available on the topic including government guidance on noise and planning:\nComments from government community secretary\nStrengthening of planning policy\nManaging noise impacts in new developments\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source 1 Heavitree, Devon Photo: James Kirkcaldy 2 Exeter Cathedral, Devon Photo: James Kirkcaldy 3 Mobile Belfry 2 at Nottingham CCCBR Road Show Photo: James Kirkcaldy 4 CCCBR porch notice CCCBR 5 Various Society badges Photo: James Kirkcaldy 6 CCCBR recruitment leaflet page 1 CCCBR Previous Chapter - Next Chapter Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/formalities/","title":"Formalities","section":"Docs","content":" Formalities # Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) # In the Church of England, the Tower Captain and anyone teaching within the tower, may need to have an up-to-date DBS check. All certification must be kept up to date. This check is normally obtained through the safeguarding officer of the relevant church. Further details are available on the DBS website.\nEquality and Diversity # There should be support for principles of equality and diversity in all aspects of ringing. Any form of discrimination is unacceptable, regardless of whether there was any intention to discriminate or not. There is a duty to ensure that there are equal opportunities for all.\nThe CCCBR equality and diversity statement defines the CCCBR policy.\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) # Any records of ringers must be in-line with statutory regulations and any requirements of the tower authority.\nPermission must be obtained from parents or guardians of under 18s. It may be that the parent or guardian does not want pictures of their child to appear on social media.\nMembership lists and contact details must be kept secure. Access should be restricted to a defined list of officers. Parental details must be held for under 18s along with a date of birth, to indicate when a minor becomes an adult.\nFurther details can be found at GDPR.\nInsurance # In the Church of England, ringers are normally included as voluntary workers on the church policy, as long as they have permission to ring. If there is any doubt then check what the cover is.\nFurther details can be found in the insurance document.\nSafeguarding # Further details can be found at safeguarding (CCCBR). This document is written specifically to explain ringing, its organisation, training and safeguarding arrangements to clergy, PCCs and Safeguarding Advisers\nIn a Church of England setting, the Tower Captain, and other persons with responsibilities, may be expected to have completed the Safeguarding Leadership training module. It may be expected that the remainder of the band should have completed the Basic and Foundation Safeguarding training modules.\nThe required levels must always be in line with the tower authority’s policies.\nAll certification must be kept up to date.\nTeaching with only a tutor and a pupil present should be avoided. This may not apply when both are members of the same immediate family.\nWhen under 18s take place in ringing and ringing related activities, including travelling, parental consent must be obtained or the parent / guardian must be present.\nBe aware of the guidelines and follow them. If there are children, young persons or vulnerable adults arriving for a session, and the appropriate number of enhanced DBS cleared and other adults do not turn up, cancel the session or ask the children, young persons or vulnerable adults to leave as soon as they can be safely escorted. A ringing room with a fair number of observing adults in it is an unlikely setting for abuse to take place. The leader running the session must quickly stamp on any bullying or unnecessary touching. The leader should be aware of any apparent friendships developing between adults and children, young persons or vulnerable adults that could lead to grooming taking place outside the ringing setting. If anything gives cause for concern, it must be discussed with the relevant safeguarding officer (Church of England parishes should have one in post).\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source Title St. David, Exeter, Devon Photo: James Kirkcaldy Previous Chapter - Next Chapter Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/finance/","title":"Finance","section":"Docs","content":" Finance # Charges and Fees # Weddings # Figure 1: Waiting for the wedding party\nIn the Church of England, the fees for wedding ringing are normally set by the PCC, preferably in consultation with the ringers at the AGM. These should reflect whether ringing is:\nBefore and/or after the wedding.\nThe length of time spent ringing.\nThe number of bells to be rung. Some towers charge proportionately.\nLikely travel times and distances of the ringers, etc.\nWhen a wedding couple pay the fee for ringing, invite them to bring it to a ringing practice. They can then see what they are paying for. Give them a warm welcome, briefly explain ringing (and why it\u0026rsquo;s a fabulous activity for couples and families) and give them a taster go (or more) at backstrokes. Any younger children with them can be given go at chiming a bell that is down. Give them flyers with your contact details on and maybe \u0026lsquo;Future Bell Ringer\u0026rsquo; stickers.\nThe couple should be advised that if there is an excessively late start ringing may not continue until that time and may be curtailed after the service. Consider setting an end time when ringing will finish, particularly for ringing after a wedding. This gives certainty of the time when ringers can get away and may help when arranging a band. This is especially useful when ringers are required at a few local churches on the same day.\nFees for other ringing # Consider having fixed fees for:\nFunerals, possibly commensurate with that for weddings.\nVisiting bands.\nQuarter peals.\nPeals.\nThese should be determined in consultation with the tower authority. When there are no fixed fees it is usual to expect voluntary donations from visiting bands and individuals.\nAvoid having a \u0026lsquo;box on the wall\u0026rsquo;, especially for downstairs rings, as these may invite theft and damage.\nFigure 2: Example of church electronic donation point\nThe church may consider having an electronic payment system for fees and casual donations. This may involve a commission charge which, although low, reduces the donation received. Within a Church of England church implementing this would be the responsibilty of the PCC and its treasurer. Such a system may allow Gift Aid to be recovered. It may allow payments for ringing to be captured in an appropriate account. N.B. Consider a request for Gift Aid as this enables income tax to be reclaimed in the case of charities and HMRC registered charitable groups.\nA series of articles about covering the following financial matters have appeared in the following issues of the Ringing World. Some of these were written by Steve Coleman. They are available to subscribers; if you are not a subscriber ask a ringer (or tower) that does subscribe.\nCharging for Teaching - 13/01/2023 (5829-27), 27/01/2023 (5831-77), 03/02/2023 (5832-97) Gift Aid - 27/01/2023 (5831-76), 10/02/2023 (5833-124), 24/02/2023 (5835-166), 10/03/2023 (5837-213), 24/03/2023 (5839-277), 28/04/2023 (5844-376) Parish Giving Scheme - 28/04/2023 (5844-376) Tower Funds - 01/09/2023 (5862-851), 22/09/2023 (5865-927), 13/10/2023 (5868-998), 17/10/2023 (5873-1121), 15/12/2023 (5877-1121) VAT - 30/06/2023 (5853-660), 14/07/2023 (5855-702) Wills and Inheritance - 07/04/2023 (5841-306) Reimbursement of Expenses # Arrangements must be made for how the ringers are to receive any such amounts. In the C of E, it is likely that a couple getting married will pay the whole cost at one time. The church then arranges the transfer of money to the various recipients. With the current reduction in the use of cash, the church may expect to do this via a bank transfer.\nTower Funds # In the C of E, funds are best held within the PCC account(s) as that is normally a registered charity and registered with HMRC for Gift Aid. This may reduce the expenditure by a third and is a positive for using PCC funds over any tower fund.\nThe fund should be identified as a “Restricted Fund” within the PCC accounts; it should NOT be a “Designated Fund” as this could be re-designated by the PCC to other projects. This can be achieved by having a covering document listing the restrictions of the funds. If a \u0026ldquo;restricted fund\u0026rdquo; there has to be a means of amending the restrictions, a definition of who can do this is essential.\nIf a tower has funds, separate from the tower authority, these should never be held by an individual. Traditionally, such funds have been used for minor repairs and social events for ringers. Such funds are not advisable. If essential, specific treasurer’s accounts are available and may be free from fees. Banks are increasingly reluctant to provide such small accounts.\nSubscriptions # The tower and/or the local society may charge a subscription, typically this is an annual fee. This should be reviewed at the relevant AGM.\nExpenditure # Agree with the tower authority, in advance, who is to pay for replaceable items e.g. ropes.\nIf a major project is envisaged the funding of this must be agreed in consultation with the tower authority. A separate document, currently under development, will cover the running of a project.\nVAT and the LPW (Listed Places of Worship) VAT recovery scheme # This only applies to places of worship within the United Kingdom and will be covered in Belfy Projects.\nFurther details are available on the LPW scheme website.\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source 1 Vicar waiting for the wedding party Photo: CCCBR 2 Electonic donation box at Wistanstow, Cheshire Photo: James Kirkcaldy Previous Chapter - Next Chapter Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/healthsafety/","title":"Health \u0026 Safety","section":"Docs","content":" Health \u0026amp; Safety # Figure 1: Ringing chamber at St. Winnow, Cornwall\nA tower is a non-domestic setting, and as such the tower authority has a duty of care over everyone that enters the site or building. If something happens on the site the tower authority is responsible and can be found negligent for everything that goes on within the building. This is why there are a lot more requirements to manage risks, together with their mitigations and documentation. This does not reduce the duty of care on ringers to minimise risk. Further details can be found in the health and safety policy advice.\nInformation specific to working in a bell chamber can be found in Belfry Upkeep Health \u0026amp; Safety.\nAll policies must be in-line with the tower authority\u0026rsquo;s policies.\nThis includes:\nRisk assessments of which there two guides:\nStandard Risk Assessment provides guidance to ringers on how they can assist their church in the preparation and maintenance of an effective risk assessment for ringing and other activities in the church tower. There is an accompanying Risk Assessment Template download which may be downloaded, and modified as required, to act as a record of a risk assessment.\nExtended Risk Assessment provides guidance on what to do in a tower where the bells have not been rung for an extended period.\nFire precautions and fire safety.\nElectrical power, lighting and emergency lighting. The inspection and test records, including annual Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) of relevant appliances. Further details on PAT can be found on the Health and Safety Executive website. Earth bonding testing of the tower and lightning protection should also be carried out by suitably qualified professionals, these would be engaged by the tower authority.\nAccidents and illness. An accident and emergency record may be present and must be completed as appropriate.\nAdvice for visitors, both ringers and non-ringers. How they are to be supervised, or not e.g. if ringing a peal. This may include induction processes, evacuation practices, turning clapper competence, maintenance records, etc.\nConsideration should be given to special occasions such as tower open days when large numbers of people may be present.\nRinging is not risk free. Your first responsibility, as the person in charge, is the safety of the ringers. Consider:\nIf a novice ringer is normally able to handle a bell but still sometimes gets into trouble, nominate an experienced ringer to stand close by to intervene if necessary.\nObserve how any unknown visitor, who says they can ring, catches hold and if it looks wrong ask them to ring the bell on their own first and stand near in case you need to intervene.\nInvite any nervous ringers and especially nervous visitors to first ring the bell a couple of times on their own.\nIf you see any signs of physical distress, especially in older ringers, call ‘Stand’ at once.\nCall ‘Stand’ if there is any significant loss of bell control or other incident.\nIf there are any worrying noises or strange rope movements, first determine whether any bells need to be rung down before investigating. If you don’t know the frame layout and relationship to the entry into the bell chamber, ring all the bells down before investigating. If in any doubt ring the bells down and curtail the session, there is always another session; there may not be a way back from a serious accident. If you think a clapper may have broken, or fallen out, set the bells having first warned the band to set carefully as a slider may have been broken.\nDisabled ringers # No set guidelines have, as yet, been developed by the CCCBR; however the following advice is offered.\nThere is a need for risk assessments both from the perspective of the tower authority and also the individual ringer. Both need to be specific to the individual ringer and individual tower. It may be necessary to seek professional help to correctly identify both risks and solutions. Of great importance is to involve ringers who are disabled, particularly of course any individual directly concerned.\nAnother significant area for consideration relates to the Equality Act 2010 and the requirement to make reasonable adjustments. Leaving aside considerations of the precise reach of this legislation, it should be applied as a standard in towers to enable the promotion of equality for ringers with a disability. A good starting point here is to have, as an ultimate aim, the ability for the person to ring safely. The process of seeking reasonable adjustments should therefore be a positive one whilst maintaining acceptable safety standards. The reasonableness of a proposed adjustment is an objective legal test taking account of a number of factors particularly its cost relative to available resources, its practicality and its likely effectiveness.\nThere has been some discussion on this issue within the ringing community. Some Tower Captains may dismiss the idea on the basis that it could never be safe for a disabled person to ring a tower bell. On the other hand there are there are articles about ringers ringing with disabilities available - Ringer with multiple sclerosis and Wheelchair ringer.\nThe question of what lies within the bounds of being sufficiently safe is therefore vexed. For this reason it is necessary to establish a well documented and fact-based assessment process both with respect to risk assessment but also the consideration of reasonable adjustments. This may require the utilisation of professional advice. Certainly all relevant people should be involved and every effort made to reach mutual agreement.\nAttendance Record(s) # These should be maintained for the purposes of safeguarding and for emergency precautions. The details to be held should be a minimum of name, entrance and exit times (including date). The tower authority may require further details to be logged.\nTowers may wish to have a separate (traditional) visitors\u0026rsquo; book as an historic record.\nAdditional requirements # The tower authority may have other requirements and these should be discussed with the authority. These may arise from insurance or other reasons.\nSpecial precautions may need to be put in place from time to time e.g., the requirements put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic. The CCCBR website will normally detail the latest guidance in such cases.\nFirst Aid Kit # Figure 2: Small first aid kit\nIdeally there should be a first aid kit in the ringing room.\nEnsure the location of the first aid kit is indicated, especially if it is elsewhere within the premises.\nRegularly check that all items are within date. The kit should be listed on the tower authority\u0026rsquo;s log of first aid kits together with records of periodic inspections.\nSecurity # Further details can be found in security for ringers.\nA limited number of keys to the building (and internal doors) may be held by the ringers. Consider the number of keys and key holders. There is a balance between security (preventing access) and enabling reasonable access. A single key for each lock is inadvisable, as this may present difficulties at times of sickness or absence. All keys should be registered with the tower authority. This may be a condition of the building insurance.\nTower Access # It may be worth producing a formal access policy in consultation with the tower authority. Further information can be found in tower access.\nEmergency exits should be clearly indicated and must never be compromised.\nSpiders and ropes should ideally be left inaccessible e.g. locked away. This is essential in accessible ringing rooms.\nTurning clappers when bells are up should be avoided in all but exceptional cases, such as heavy bells that are extremely difficult or impossible to rise right-sided.\nInformation, for those working on bell installations, is available in Belfry Upkeep.\nBells should not be left up (raised) for extended periods between ringing sessions, especially where access to the bell and ringing rooms is not secured. This may not apply to heavier rings e.g. where the tenor is over 20cwt. However, in such cases, access must be controlled. Such access should be limited to experienced ringers and trained people.\nThere is advice on the Eccclesiatical Insurance Group website, however this is not written by the CCCBR. The following summary appeared in the Ringing World:\nIf bells are left up at the end of a ringing session then Ecclesiastical Insurance has some guidance on things to consider.\nWho might have access to the bells whilst they are up? This might include members of the PCC, clock-winders, telecom aerial maintenance people, visitors on tower tours, etc.. Are these people aware of the hazards? The PCC might be well-trained on what to look out for and safe paths through the ringing room and bell chamber, but other visitors may not. Are all visitors to the tower accompanied by someone familiar with the route and the dangers? Just because someone is deemed competent does not mean that an accident will not occur. Consider the adequacy of the precautions in place. What precautions are in place to protect these people? Are the ringing room and bell chamber doors securely locked? Are all keyholders known? Are warning signs displayed? It can be helpful to have a contact name and number on these for last-minute queries. Is there any way of caging in the bell frame, or directing people around the bell frame? Is there an alternative route that avoids passing through the bell chamber? Are the ropes in the ringing chamber secured whilst the bells are up? A simple padlock on the spider is often sufficient. Are there warning signs advising visitors to not touch the ropes? Have safety arrangements been reviewed, reflecting the risks presented? Have necessary precautions been implemented to protect people? Can the risk be removed completely? For example, if the clock-winder comes every Wednesday and has to pass through the bell chamber, ring the bells down after Tuesday practice! Other Tower Users # Figure 3: Ground floor ringing chamber\nThere may be other users of the tower and its internal spaces. These, their access and usage requirements will need consideration. Users may include clock winder(s), flag raiser(s), flower arrangers, creches. Clergy and choirs are often users of ground floor areas and may do so at the same time as ringers.\nFigure 4: Rope barrier to limit access to ringing area\nConsideration also needs to be given to visitors on open days and the general public, especially in ground floor installations. Ropes at ground floor rings should be raised on a spider. The spider should be inaccesible to the casual visitor by being secured. It is a good idea to place a physical barrier, as in the rope in the above picture, to dissuade non-ringers entering the ringing area whilst rining is in progress.\nThere may also be persons requiring access to other installations (such as mobile telephone equipment housed in the tower).\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source 1 Ringing chamber at St Winnow, Cornwall Photo: James Kirkcaldy 2 Small first aid kit Photo: Tony Crabtree 3 Ground floor ringing room Photo: Tony Crabtree 4 Ground floor ringing room with rope barrier Photo: Alison Hodge Previous Chapter - Next Chapter Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/emergency/","title":"Emergency","section":"Docs","content":"The following items should ideally be found in a tower, especially the first.

Further information can be found at Belfry Upkeep Faculty Rules. Figure 1: Welcoming ringing chamber\nThe ringing room should be kept tidy and welcoming. This reduces risk and gives a good impression to any visitors, especially potential recruits.\nThe following short videos were prepared by Tom Ridgman, Ely Diocesan Bells Adviser and are hosted on YouTube. We are grateful for permission to reuse this material. The links are:\nFigure 2: Making ringers welcome and comfortable\nFigure 3: Looking after ringing rooms and access\nThe CCCBR have produced Tower environments and their suitability for recruiting and retaining ringers which provides a light but serious look at some key issues.\nAccess # This is covered in health and safety.\nBoxes # Figure 4: Stacked boxes\nConsider whether the boxes:\nare secure and suitable for use. are suitably sized. A ringer should not feel any risk of being too near the edge. are carpeted. This allows them to be stacked safely and without sliding for very young ringers. The use of multiple boxes ought to be avoided whenever possible. can be wedged if there are uneven floors. Further details are available at notes on ringing boxes. This document details how to make a 2ft x 2ft box which is stackable. \u0026ldquo;Fixed\u0026rdquo; boxes at towers e.g. Exeter (see picture below) are typically larger. The height generally needs to increase and be roughly in a ratio of 0.5-0.6 to the width. There are Health and Safety implications of high (fixed) boxes, but there are also positive sides to them.\nPositive reasons for using boxes:\nReduced rope wear, as the rope goes into compression (this induces fibre slip and wearing out) when it meets a solid surface. Reduces the risk of a trip hazard from the tail end coiling up around or under the ringer\u0026rsquo;s feet. Negative reasons for using boxes:\nNeed to consider the need for edge protection. Boxes up to 600mm height do not need to have edge protection, in accordance with HSE guidance on unguarded edges,. A learner may be at risk of falling off/ver when told to move away on losing control of the rope. Consider whether a box for a heavy bell should be fixed or not. Fixed boxes may become used as storage space. If this is the case consider what goes in them. It is not a good place to store the first aid kit.\nCarpets and Rope Mats # Figure 5: Modern carpet, mats and boxes:\nThese should be fit for purpose. They are especially important on stone floors. Try to avoid walking on rope mats as any grit or mud on shoes may be as damaging as the floor. Both carpets and rope mats should be kept clean.\nIdeally, mats should not overlap as this introduces a trip hazard.\nRope mats can be obtained from carpet suppliers as offcuts or from old pattern books.\nThere is a commonly held belief that wool is better, however this anecdotal. Most rope wear is a result of the compression when the rope comes into contact with another surface.\nCeiling, Rope Guides, Spiders # Figure 6: Rope guide for twelve bells\nConsider whether the rope bosses are at the optimum height. If too high the ropes can be flighty. If too low the sallies can “jump” when coming down at backstroke. The ideal height is typically such that the sally of the lightest bell just reachs the guide whilst that of the heaviest bell does not go completely through. It may be neccesary in very heavy rings to have guides at different heights for the lighter and heavier bells.\nCeiling boss material and the contact surface area has a huge effect on how a bell rope wears out. Cast iron generally corrodes and becomes abrasive to ropes, generally wearing the rope immediately above the sally. A dense timber may be better as it holds a polish and does not abrade the ropes. If unsure, seek expert advice, from your Society, CCCBR, or a professional bell hanger.\nIf the rope circle is poor or very unequally spaced, consider seeking advice as above, especially when there are ropes very close together.\nChiming Apparatus # Figure 7 (left): Ellacombe chiming apparatus. Figure 8 (right): Electronic control unit and spider control\nThis includes Ellacombe apparatus, chiming hammers, clock hammers and electronic units (e.g., Apollo and similar). Ensure that these are correctly set before ringing, especially when the apparatus is not in the ringing room. A warning notice should be prominently displayed. This should include advice on how to setand check the setting of the apparatus. The picture on the left shows an ellacombe apparatus and the picture on the right shows the controls for the operation of an electronic unit (alongside controls for an electrically operated spider).\nCoat Hooks # Consider whether these are fit for purpose and are in suitable locations. Ensure that coat hooks do not lead to important items being hidden such as emergency equipment, light switches, clock hammers. Ensure that these do not impinge on a ringer\u0026rsquo;s position. The use of free standing coat stands should be discouraged as these can be dislodged or caught by flying ropes.\nCurtains / blinds # These are primarily to prevent ringers being blinded by sunlight. Heavy curtains may also be an effective way to shut off an open staircase, door way or open gallery. They may assist in enabling the ringing room to be heated without heating other unused areas such as the rest of the building, staircase, etc. Curtains can also serve to deaden excessive echo in a ringing room.\nElectrical Devices # Power points and powered devices should be checked by a professional, approved by the tower authority. Any portable electrical equipment should be subject to regular checks. Devices must be included in the tower authority\u0026rsquo;s register of electrical equipment. If there are too few power points, then additional points should be installed rather than using extension leads and adaptors. Do not daisy chain from one socket.\nHeating # Consider arrangements to make the environment comfortable. In summer this may include adequate ventilation. In winter this may include heating. If heating is present this must be with the approval of the tower authority. Free standing heaters should not be used. If the ringing room is open to the rest of the building it is worth investigating the use of screens or curtains to enclose the area.\nLighting # Figure 9: Well lit ringing chamber\nFurther details can be found at lighting in and around towers.\nIn the ringing room:\nConsider the placing of the lighting. Ideally the lighting should be placed centrally to the rope circle; this will illuminate the ringers from both above and the front. Ensure there is enough light within the rope circle and not just around the walls. Uplighters may look good, but the reflectivity of the ringing room may mean they do not work. Uplighters require more energy to achieve an acceptable light level and work best when combined with downlighters, lighting the space at eye level (approximately 6 foot) to waist level (approximately 3 foot) for the ringers.\nensure that there at least two light sources. This provides a back-up should one fail or is smashed by a wild rope. If in doubt, fit more lights than originally considered. Ideally engage a professional to help with design. 400-500 lumen at eye level (approximately 6 foot from the floor) is a good starting point when ringing.\nLighting needs to be maintained, e.g. bulbs changed, therefore the light fittings should be safely accessible.\nThere should be a battery back-up to protect against a blown fuse or power failure in at least one light fitting. The lighting should be \u0026lsquo;safety lighting\u0026rsquo; not \u0026rsquo;exit lighting\u0026rsquo;. The former is brighter. There is further information at Oxford Diocesan Guild website emergency lighting. N.B. This document is to be updated.\nIf the ringing room has large windows consider some means of reducing direct sunlight which may temporarily blind the ringers e.g. curtains or blinds.\nNotices Boards and Information # Figure 10: Notice board\nEnsure that notice board(s) display up-to-date information, such as tower and Society notices. There is little point in displaying details of past events.\nThe CCCBR have published a number of notices, intended for ringing room notice boards, they can be accessed (and downloaded) from here.\nRinging Records # Visitor book # Tower records of visitors, quarter peals and peals. Within churches in the Church of England, these are formally part of the Parish records. Further information can be found in the History and Archive work group pages.\nFigure 11: Visitor\u0026rsquo;s book\nA band may wish to maintain a visitor\u0026rsquo;s book. This can offer information on who has visited in the past when researching.\nPeal boards # Figure 12: Selection of peal boards\nPeal and other commemorative boards, certificates and photographs. Are these recorded elsewhere? It is a good idea to maintain a quality photographic record of these in a separate location. There are persons who do produce boards to order, there details are often advertised in the Ringing World and on social media. Putting up a board in a tower requires consultation with the tower authority and an Archdeacons’ consultation in a Church of England church. Useful advice on this is provided in an article New peal boards and restorations in the 30 June 2023 issue of The Ringing World (p 675). A list of specialists providing peal boards is included in the Specialist Services chapter of Belfry Upkeep. Older peal boards may require restoration. The same specialist firms may be able to assist in this work.\nTrophies # Figure 13 (Left): Ringing trophies - Exeter Cathedral; Figure 14 (Right): Ringing trophies - Kingsteignton\nThese are the usually the property of the awarding body. However, they are in the care of the tower and should be kept securely. Insurance of these items is normally the responsibility of the awarding body.\nRopes # See information in the rope section of Belfry Upkeep.\nFigures 15-18: Variety of knots used to tie bell ropes\nThere are many different ways of tying a bell rope. It is important not to rely on the type of knot as an indication of whether a bell is raised or not. This should always be done by taking hold of the rope as if about to ring and then feeling whether it is set or not. Adjusting tail end length may take two forms as indicated below. N.B. In the West Country, especially Call Change towers, the adjustment of ropes may not be permitted.\nUntucking and tucking the tail end. This is acceptable, provided it is done carefully, using a spike or fid, to separate the strands. This should not be done for every touch Tying a knot, usually a ‘Figure-eight’ knot, to shorten a long rope. This is a short-term measure and is normally acceptable as the knot is removed after use. It is a good idea to have a few usable spares to cover any bell, as needed. Natural fibre ropes degrade whether in use or not. Ropes kept in a box may appear to be in good condition, but the fibres will have decayed whilst not used. Ropes should be stored so as to prevent attack by vermin. Each rope should be labelled to indicate which bell(s) it is for.\nIf there is not at least one person able, and willing, to check the ropes at suitable intervals than a local society \u0026rsquo;expert\u0026rsquo; may be able to assist. If a person is available locally, they should be able to identify and correct any wear points, change or repair a rope if needed. If ropes do need professional maintenance or replacement there are a number of manufacturers. Their details are often advertised in the Ringing World and on social media.\nIf unsure, consider contacting your local Society or the CCCBR.\nSeating # Seating may consist of chairs, benches, etc. They should be free of obstacles that may be picked up by a rope whilst ringing. Ideally, they should be enough away from the ropes to prevent a moving rope hooking them. A carefully designed stack of boxes may provide additional seating when the boxes are not in use. Consider whether there is adequate seating to accommodate people not ringing. The size of the tower may restrict the amount of seating.\nAlways consider whether the seating is fit for purpose.\nStorage # Consider whether storage spaces need to be lockable. This is especially important when the ringing room is readily accessible. It may also be necessary to lock any higher value items away.\nTools # Figure 19: Collection of tools suitable for bell installations\nThese should be usable and not simply rusted away. It may be preferable for the Steeple Keeper (or person doing maintenance) to provide their own tools. Tower tools may have a habit of “walking” or being misused, even by well-intentioned people!\nTeaching aids and a suitable space for teaching. # This may include model bell(s), simulator(s), books and pictures of the bells above. The latter may include CCTV as explained below. Information on teaching ringing is available on the ART webpages.\nThe following is a list of possible assets, though not exhaustive. In all cases consider whether these are kept securely and are adequately insured for loss or damage.\nDisplay bell(s) # Figure 20: Model demonstration bell\nIf possible, a model bell should be portable allowing its use for demonstrations outside of the tower.\nHandbells # Figure 21: Set of handbells in carrying cases\nIf these are not usable, consider restoration otherwise they are merely a display item.\nIf handbells are considered a useful resource a cheap option is a set of eight “rainbow” handbells. These are readily available, inexpensive, robust and ideal for teaching place-counting, etc.\nFurther details are available at Handbells\nSimulators # Figure 22: Simulator installation in ringing room\nAll components should be kept securely and the electrical components must have been PAT tested by an approved contractor. Any fixed wiring needs to be inspected every couple of years by a qualified electrician. Any fixed wiring should also have been installed by an electrician to BS7671. This generally covers circuits up to sockets, anything plugged into a socket is portable appliance.\nThe Ringing Experience # The Volunteer and Leadership work group pages should also be consulted.\nSound # Consider the sound levels in the ringing room good. If it is too echoey, consider a carpet or large rug may reduce this. Curtains and soft furnishings may also help. If the bells “shout” down through a trap door, or through the stair door, some form of insulation may reduce or redress the matter.\nConsider the external acoustics. The bells may cause annoyance to neighbours if especially loud. There may be a professional means of reducing this.\nFurther advice may be available from your local Society or the CCCBR. If the problem is larger then consult a professional. There is further information at sound control (CCCBR).\nOther areas to consider # CCTV # Figure 23: CCTV display in ringing room\nThis may cover multiple areas. Images of the ringing room and bell chamber are useful for visitors who may not be able to access the tower. Images of the bell chamber are useful for learners. Images of other areas in and around the building may provide additional security, etc.\nCommunication # Links to the body of the building, especially where the ringing room is separate, need to be considered. The answer may be as simple as a bell pull or as complex as a telephone/visual communication system. This can assist with timings for events (especially weddings at churches) and other activities within the building.\nKitchen # This may consist of a kettle, mugs and a means of taking the latter away for cleaning. These must be compliant with hygiene requirements. There may be restricted access when this is the main part of the building.\nToilet(s) # As these may be in the main part of the building access may be restricted.\nParking # There may be accessible parking as part of the premises although access is probably, restricted especially at times when events (including church services). In town settings it may be worthwhile publicising where the nearest accessible parking can be found.\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source 1 Ringing room at St Machar, Aberdeen Photo: CCCBR archive 2 Making ringers welcome and comfortable Video: Tom Ridgman 3 Looking after ringing rooms and access Video: Tom Ridgman 4 Pile of carpeted boxes Photo: Tony Crabtree 5 Carpets, mats and boxes at Exeter Cathedral Photo: James Kirkcaldy 6 Rope Guide frame at Melbourne, Derbyshire Photo: James Kirkcaldy 7 Ellacombe chiming apparatus Photo: James Kirkcaldy 8 Electronic control unit and spider control at Exeter Cathedral Photo: James Kirkcaldy 9 Well lit ringing room at Great Barton, Suffolk Photo: CCCBR archive 10 Notice board Photo: Tony Crabtree 11 Visitor\u0026rsquo;s book Photo: Tony Crabtree 12 Peal boards at St Mark, Exeter Photo: James Kirkcaldy 13 Competition trophies at Exeter Cathedral Photo: James Kirkcaldy 14 Competition trophies at Kingsteignton, Devon Photo: James Kirkcaldy 15-18 Selection of knots in bell ropes Photo: James Kirkcaldy 19 Collection of tools suitable for use on a bell installation Photo: Tony Crabtree 20 Model demonstration bell Photo: Tony Crabtree 21 Set of fourteen handbells in carrying cases Photo: James Kirkcaldy 22 Using the simulator at Great Gransden, Cambridgeshire Photo: CCCBR archive 23 Multiple channel CCTV at Ledbury, Herefordshire Photo: Alison Hodge Previous Chapter - Next Chapter Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/bellchamber/","title":"Bell Chamber","section":"Docs","content":" Bell Chamber # The bell installation is covered specifically by Belfy Upkeep. The information here deals with the need for specific items.\nFigure 1: Modern bell installation\nRingers are often the only ones with regular access to parts of the church building and have a \u0026lsquo;duty of care\u0026rsquo;. However they are not the people with overall responsibility. Bell chambers should never be visited alone. It is strongly advised that a second person, who is also suitably experienced, is present. Muffles # Figure 2 (left): Leather fastening muffle. Figure 3 (right): Velcro fastening muffle\nThere are two basic types of muffle. The older type (above left) is attached by means of leather straps and/or leather thongs. The newer type (above right) makes use of Velcro fastening. As muffles are used infrequently, regularly check them for deterioration, do not leave it until they are required. Cable ties may be used to ensure that muffles are firmly fixed, however when removing these be careful to not cut the muffles.\nEnsure that it is known how to fit muffles correctly. Muffles should be fitted with the bells down and, as in all cases when work is undertaken in the bell chamber, with a second person present. When not in use muffles should be stored in a fabric bag, ideally hung in the ringing room. They should not be thrown into a cupboard which may be damp and therefore cause deterioration.\nMuffles are, traditionally, used on a limited number of occasions such as funerals, remembrance Sunday, ringing out the old year. On most occasions bells are half-muffled, that is a single muffle is fitted. Traditionally the backstroke is muffled, in which case the muffle sits on the clapper on the side away from where the rope drops from the wheel when the bell is down. Bells are traditionally only rung fully muffled (or deeply muffled i.e. with the backstroke of the tenor unmuffled) for the death of a reigning monarch, the incumbent (Parish Priest), or the Bishop of the Diocese.\nSilencers # There are various types and means of fitting.\nFigure 4: Wooden clapper tie\nA wooden tie that holds the clapper in the middle of the bell.\nFigure 5 (left): Rope tie showing fastening to headstock. Figure 6 (right): Rope tie showing attachment to clapper\nA rope may be used to tie the clapper. It may be preferred to tie the clapper on the hand stroke side for teaching basic bell handling so as not to be fine-set, as in the above picture. It may be preferred to tie the clapper centrally when the main objective is simulator work. It is important to ensure that rope ends are secured else they may catch on other items and cause issues.\nFigure 7: ART style tie\nART recommend a tie based around an old cycle inner tube.\nFigure 8 (left): Tyre silencer set for quiet ringing. Figure 9 (right): Tyre silencer set for open ringing.\nA silencer may also be made from a piece of tyre. They can be easily twisted through 90° to un-silence the bell and may prove useful where there are learners.\nSound Control # Sound control may be present. This may consist of shutters, trapdoors, etc. Installations are bespoke to individual towers. It is essential that the method of operation is well documented alongside when it should be used.

The appointments may be subject to confirmation by the tower authority. Consider whether a maximum length of tenure of any office is appropriate. The simplest manner is to consider all offices resigned at the annual meeting. Ideally, meetings should be held annually. Others may be held as required. The agenda should be distributed in advance together with a request for items to be included in any other business. An agenda is meant to keep a meeting on track.\nThe person chairing the meeting should be aware of the focus of the meeting and not allow digression. They should be aware of the anticipated timescale and keep to this. The chair may not be one of the ringers. In a religious institution the incumbent is a good choice. A church warden or PCC representative may be a suitable alternative. In a tower within a non-religious setting, a representative of the tower authority would be a good choice. Such examples offer impartiality and enables the chair to meet the ringers and hear about the activities of the ringers.\nA sample agenda for an annual meeting.\nAppointment of Officers # Further details on the appointment of a tower captain. Any appointment should be made in agreement with the tower authority. The officers are there to run the tower, provide points of contact and to relieve the pressure on one individual. The potential roles may include:\nTower Captain. Overall responsibility. Ringing Master. Runs the ringing. Secretary. Looks after the administration. Treasurer. Looks after the funds and expenditure. Steeple Keeper. Looks after the installation. Social Secretary. Looks after the non-ringing events. If there are a number of ringers attached to the tower, it is a good idea to engage as many members as possible. There are plenty of additional roles which may be used e.g., Deputy, Secretary, Instructor, Conductor, Librarian. Roles, especially deputy, instructor and conductor should not undermine the authority of the tower captain or raise expectations of future election to other posts.\nCalendar # Maintain a calendar which is publicised to all, including the tower authority. This may be printed or held by some electronic means. The calendar should list:\nThe weekly, monthly schedule. Annual dates e.g. ringers’ dinner, tower outing(s), AGM. Special events e.g. particular Saint’s days, (church) patronal festival, fetes. Public Open days, e.g. heritage open days. Training days, teaching sessions when not a practice night. Consider when to ring and when not to ring. Occasions to ring include Sunday services, weddings, funerals, church events, national events, patronal day, local festivals and traditions. It is worth compiling a list for your tower. Occasions not to ring may include Holy Week, see the “Ringing Forums” discussion.\nThere are proprietary apps available that might be of use in arranging a calendar, e.g. WhatsApp, Band.\nArranging Ringing # If you are not used to running ringing, doing so can seem daunting. There is no need for it to be so. You are going to ask certain ringers to try and ring certain things. This means you have to judge who can ring what and what they will find useful or, ideally and, enjoy. No one gets that right all the time. With practice you will get better at it. Further suggestions on how to run a ringing session.\nPerhaps the most important things to remember are:\nRingers are volunteers. They are at the session because they want to be. Ringers are human. They have good days and bad days. What they can ring well one time they might struggle with the next. Ringing is a team activity. How well we ring and how much pleasure we get from it depends on how well the band rings; not just on how well the individual rings. The following are a series of tips to running ringing. Not all will be applicable to you and the ringing that you are running. You do not need to remember, let alone master, them all when you start. You will discover which work in your unique circumstances. There is no standard tower nor standard ringing session. With that in mind here are some tips.\nKnow your ringers # This is not always possible if there are visitors. Generally you need to be aware:\nWhy your ringers come to a ringing session. What their skill level is. At a practice what, if anything, they want to improve on. If there are visitors you don’t know then ask them if and what they can ring. Suggest some rounds for them to ‘get a feel of the bells’. When they ring, judge for yourself how accurate their statements were. Figure 2: Young ringers in action\nPurpose # Decide what you want to achieve, both as a band and for individuals. If you can, publicise what is to be rung and why, a few days before each session. As far as attendance and performance allows, try and ring what was advertised. If you were unable to ring what you said, briefly explain why at the end of the session. Remember the ringers are volunteers, the degree to which you can structure a session will vary with the band and with individuals. Some ringers may come to sessions mainly to get out of the house and socialise as part of a group. They may well be happy to get better at ringing, but it may not be a prime consideration. On the other hand, some may want to progress their ringing more. Having some, if only loose, structure to a session should help keep more people happy as they can see there is something in it for them.\nRecruitment and maintaining a band # Further details can be found at Guidance notes - recruitment and retention (CCCBR).\nThere are resources available at CCCBR Publicity material resources. These include:\nRecruitment Leaflet - designed for distribution to the general public. Printed copies are available on request. Tower Open Day poster - to be used for promotion of such days. Porch Notice - to display essential information about ringing at the tower. Engaging with the Public - useful information for engaging the public with ringing and any ringing-related activity taking place. Publicity Flyer: ‘Bell Ringing is fun and …’ - This leaflet was produced by Sue Hall, originally for the Derby Diocesan Association. It is downloadable and customisable. The following CCCBR guidance is available:\nSocial media. Running a successful open day. Teaching and developing visiting other towers, striking competitions, special practices.\nThe Association of Ringing Teachers provides a structured set of guidelines.\nSafeguarding # See information contained at Formalities - Safeguarding.\nSafety # See information contained in Health \u0026amp; Safety.\nSocial # In many groups of ringers there is a social side to the ringing. This may invove such things as:\ngoing for a drink (not necessarily a pub) after ringing. holding a regular dinner, typically at Christmas time. outings to experience different bells, towers and areas of the country. Some suggestions for organising an outing. outings without ringing content. Subscriptions # These may be required for the individual tower or the local society. There may be others, such as a tower subscription to The Ringing World.\nTeaching # This may include:\nhandling skills. developing listening skills. call-changes. methods to all levels. The primary source of information is ART.\nVisitors # Is there an agreed policy for the number of visiting bands, how long such ringing should last and any special considerations around timings. The latter may particularly apply when the bells are intrusive. It is to be hoped that visiting bands always try to perform well.\nThe Guild of Clerical Ringers document (CCCBR) covers some of these topics from a clergy point of view.\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source 1 Ringing room at Great Barton, Suffolk Photo: CCCBR archive 2 Young ringers in action at St Bartholomew, Nettlebed Photo: CCCBR archive Previous Chapter - Next Chapter Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/irregular/","title":"Bells not rung regularly","section":"Docs","content":" Bells not rung regularly # The following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nFigure 1: Infrequently used ringing room\nWe no longer have a team of bell ringers in our village. What do we do to ensure that the bells remain in good order?\u0026quot; # The answer to this question is complex, as it depends on many factors: the number of times they may be rung and for how long; frequency and quality of past maintenance and inspections; age/type of the installation (old-style or modern); whether belfry and tower is generally well maintained; enthusiasm of the tower authority; and so on.\nModern installations generally require less frequent maintenance than old-style installations. The sealed bearings of modern types won’t deteriorate through inactivity, whereas older style plain bearings will tend to seize up if not used, or dry up if they leak (and this then depends on some regular maintenance and inspection). Also, the woodwork of recent installations will generally be newer, so more durable and less prone to movement by longer-term use and better attachment to other parts.\nAs a minimum we advise that bells should be rung at least 4 times at intervals through the year, and once a month would be far better. Maintaining bells in good condition is NOT just dependent on the bells being rung. In fact, occasional ringing without any inspection and maintenance could risk more damage and even injury to ringers or others!\nPeriodic inspection # This is vital and a professional bellhanger’s annual service contract is ideal, probably essential, if bells are rung infrequently. In this way, the installation will be inspected as for an ‘MOT’ test on a car.\nWhen bells are rung infrequently, (say less than once a month) then it is important for them to be checked every time before and after they are rung by a competent person who is fully familiar with bell installations. The checks could be a condition of ringing the bells, imposed by the the tower authority and should ensure that ropes and stays and other key elements are all in good order, hence minimising risk of injury (and this should be the overriding concern) and / or damage. The tightness of fittings (wood can shrink in hot, dry weather, leaving slackness and movement) should be checked. Additionally, there is the need to look at the frame and the ways it attaches to the tower. The bells themselves may be OK, but frame movement is damaging. The frame may need tightening (especially wooden frames when dry), but it might be more than that, in which case professional help may be necessary. Such an inspection will look for evidence of vermin (especially birds and squirrels). In some locations and certain times of the year, this can be a particular challenge. Squirrels are much more capable of entering because they can wriggle into places that birds can’t. They require professional pest controllers to catch them and, more importantly, kill them, which is what the law demands. All this and more is explained in \u0026lsquo;Belfry Upkeep\u0026rsquo;.\nHow can this be achieved? # Figure 2: Tidy up needed\nThere is a lot to be gained if one ringer from a neighbouring tower is appointed to look after a rarely rung tower. This is the practice in many areas where towers are not rung regularly. They become familiar with the ring, and develop a knowledge of particular issues that affect that particular installation, since every single one is absolutely unique rather than being mass produced identically. If you do not know who to consult, then your local ringing society should be involved as they will know volunteers who have relevant specialist knowledge who will advise.\nOther factors that should be considered if bells are not rung regularly include the experience and knowledge of the tower authority. They will often not be familiar with bells; some may keep the building wind and water-tight, clean and tidy, well maintained and frequently checked, while others are less well set up. Having said that, wellintentioned non-specialists must NOT be expected or asked to do the types of checks mentioned above. We also strongly recommend that the tower, ringing room, and intermediate rooms, and bell chamber are kept accessible, clean and tidy. Having said that, books, records, peal boards, photographs, visitors books, records etc, should NOT be removed or destroyed even if there is no band of ringers. This is likely to contain valuable information.\nMore positively, we recommend that a band is reinstated at the tower, or arrangements are made for practices to be run at the tower on a regular basis. This is far better than assuming that ringing will not occur. It is recognised that an active band of ringers and regular ringing are often good ways of building and maintaining involvement of the local community with the tower. Neighbours are also accustomed to hearing the sound of bells and will be less likely to object if they are only rung very occasionally. Even while you there are no localringers, regular ringing can be arranged for example, by alternating the practice venue with other local towers. Your local ringing society may well be willing to help get ringing going again, both for practices and services.\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source 1 Infrequently used ringing room Photo: CCCBR 2 Tidy up needed Photo: Alison Hodge Previous Chapter - Next Chapter Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, December 2022\n© 2022 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/communication/yourcare/","title":"Bells in Your Care","section":"Communication","content":" Bells in Your Care # Some notes for incumbents and churchwardens who find themselves responsible for a ring of church bells.\nThe following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nBell Ringing # The sound of church bells ringing out can provide very loud evidence of the existence of an active church with an active congregation and you are fortunate to have bells in your care. Ringers and the CCCBR can help with anything you need to know. This is a brief summary.\nFigure 1: Ropes hanging on spider.\nThe very English art of full circle ringing has been practised in this country for over 400 years, and more recently in other countries around the world. The skill, which takes several months to acquire, lies in controlling the bell as it swings full circle so that it can be made to sound at a precise point - like, indeed, any other musical instrument. Younger people generally learn more quickly, but most people between the ages of 11 and 70, or more, can learn to ring.\nBecause ringing is by definition a group activity (one ringer for each bell being rung), each tower with a ring of bells usually has a local band, led by its chosen tower captain, and usually belonging to the local ringing society. These in turn are affiliated to the CCCBR, which through its committees seeks to provide help and information about all bell matters, including maintenance of towers and belfries, fundraising, redundant bells, publications, public relations and much more.\nThis \u0026lsquo;Running a Tower\u0026rsquo; document has advice about tower management, health and safety and fire risk assessment for bell towers, amongst much more information. Alternatively, contact your local ringing society, or DAC bells adviser.\nThe Mechanics # Figure 2: Modern bell installation.\nNearly all Church of England churches have at least one bell, and a substantial minority (6000 in England, 500 in other English-speaking countries) have rings of five or more bells hung in the English style, so that the bells can be swung through a full circle by means of a rope and wheel, with one ringer for each bell.\nSets of bells which can be sounded in other ways, by means of hammers of some kind, or by swinging each bell through just a small arc by means of a lever or an incomplete wheel, are called \u0026lsquo;chimes\u0026rsquo; rather than \u0026lsquo;rings\u0026rsquo;. If your bells are hung together in a frame, each with a full wheel, they will probably have been intended for full-circle ringing (although if they are not being used regularly by competent ringers, and have perhaps been neglected for some time, they may not be immediately suitable for ringing without initial inspection and maintenance or repair).\nPlease take an early opportunity to visit your tower in the company of the tower captain (the ringers\u0026rsquo; leader), or of some other competent ringer. For your own safety, NEVER, ever, go up the tower alone: church towers are fascinating but lonely places, and a fall might mean lying undiscovered for hours. Moreover, especially if the bells have been left ready to ring in the mouth-upward position (referred to as \u0026lsquo;UP\u0026rsquo;), going close to them, or touching them or the ropes, could be very dangerous, and as well as possibly causing injury, could also cause expensive damage to the bells and related fittings, as the tower captain will explain.\nIf, at present, you do not have any ringers at your tower, for help and support, contact your local ringing society. Alternatively, your local DAC will have a bells adviser who can either advise you directly, or put you in touch with the local society.\nBenefits of Bells and Ringers # Figure 3: Ringing meeting.\nRobert van de Weyer, in his book on the Country Church, said:\n“The Christians within a village are like the bells which ring out over its rooftops on Sunday morning. There are not many of them, yet everyone in the village is aware of them. They are gentle and reassuring, yet at times they disturb people. They have been there a very long time, yet they never go out of date. People are slow to respond to their call, but they are regarded with great love and goodwill. To everyone they are a sign of hope and a source of comfort.”\nOthers have said:\n“I would give you two examples of how ringing in our tower has had an effect on the parish, apart from letting the locals know we are there every time we ring. The first is that of nine ringers attached to our tower five were not church goers before they took up ringing. Two of them now come occasionally, but almost every week ring for service and join in with church socials on a regular basis. The second is the opportunity to show a welcome to non church people. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen often, but on a few occasions over the last couple of years, on our practice nights people have spotted us going in and asked if they might come in to the church.”\n“Our band is, roughly, 2/3 non-churchgoers. All of us, however, ring for Sunday service, share in the rota for providing tea/coffee after the Sunday morning service, provide staffing for one or more stalls at the winter/summer fairs, spread awareness of the church\u0026rsquo;s friendliness through talking about ringing there with other friends, run a FB page about our activities that nonringers subscribe to, and act as general awareness-raisers about the possibility of hiring the church hall, etc. Some of the band who do attend services regularly also serve on parish committees, take part in the transport rota for infirm members of the congregation, etc. If an organisation had to pay for all that input I think it would be quite costly.”\n“We run three tower open days each year. The Dean recognises this contribution as part of the Cathedral outreach. The open days are very popular with tourists and local people alike. Each time there are a significant number of local people who have never entered the Cathedral before, despite living in the city all their lives.”\n“I think you can be either taken for granted by some clergy or really valued\u0026hellip; wish more clergy took an interest.”\nFrequently Asked Questions # Who can I ask about the state of the bells and fittings in our tower? # If your church has an active band of ringers, their leader the tower captain can advise on sources of information; or you can contact the local bell-ringing association or DAC bells adviser: contact information.\nFigure 4: Practice session.\nWhy is necessary to practice every week? # As with any musical activity, development and maintenance of the required skills requires regular practice.\nHow long does it take to train a ringer? # Learning to control a bell accurately requires skill: developing the necessary skill can take many months. Different people learn at different rates, but 10-15 hours of individual tuition, followed by many more hours learning to ring with other ringers, is not uncommon.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t ringers always stay to the service? # For any number of reasons! They may have other services to attend or to ring for, in other churches; they will already have spent half an hour or more in the church, and may have other interests and commitments; and they may not even be christians - in which case it may be helpful to know that ringing has been a gentle door into church life for many. You may find it of benefit to arrange sometimes to visit the ringers in the ringing chamber to pray with them, during ringing before services, or during their practices. This should help to foster links between the ringers and the rest of the church community.\nShould I let visiting ringers ring our bells? # If you possibly can, yes. The tower captain or tower secretary should be able to recognise bona fide requests, and will normally make the necessary arrangements when requests for additional ringing sessions have been received, after checking that the timing will not conflict with other church activities. Visiting bands will normally leave a donation towards the costs of maintenance of bells and ropes. Visiting other towers and ringing on different bells is an excellent way for individual ringers or bands of ringers to gain experience and make progress with their ringing. There is a strong tradition of welcome and cooperation among ringers; and your ringers too should find visits to other towers enjoyable and helpful. Also - the more your bells are rung, the more it will remind those outside of your church’s presence.\nShould ringers charge for ringing for weddings? # It is normal practice for a fee to be charged for wedding ringing. Nowadays, the ringers need to be compensated for the time and cost of travelling to and from the tower, at least as much as for the effort they put into the actual ringing. A policy about payment, including the amount to be charged, should be discussed and agreed with the bell-ringers in advance. The fee is usually paid by the wedding couple, often directly to the ringers. Ringers are volunteers and are generally not legally employees of the church. For advice, have a look at Steve Coleman’s articles \u0026lsquo;Ringing and Money\u0026rsquo; on the Ringing World website, this may require subscriber access.\nWho should appoint the tower captain? # Ringers soon learn who among their number is competent to lead them. An accepted leader, democratically elected by the band, with the election ratified by the incumbent, is the ideal. This is further explained within this \u0026lsquo;Running a Tower\u0026rsquo; document.\nHow do I deal with complaints about noise? # Reasonably and openly in the first instance. Refer to the CCCBR leaflet on Noise, the Law and the Environmental Health Office. The CCCBR also offer a Complaints Helpline, through which additional advice can be obtained quickly.\nFigure 5: Getting ready to ring.\nWhat about Safety? # The heaviest bell in your tower may weigh a ton or more, and heavy masses of moving metal must not be treated \u0026lsquo;unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly\u0026rsquo;. In a nutshell, it\u0026rsquo;s important that access to the bells should be restricted only to those who know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing: The tower should never be left unlocked; and if the ringers ring from ground floor level, that area too should either be kept locked when not in use, or at least bell ropes, and controls for clock chimes or other chiming hammers, should somehow be secured so as to minimise risks of interference and damage. Such controls may need to be disconnected before each ringing session, and reconnected afterwards.\nBells and bell-ropes should only be touched by experienced ringers or by learners under the supervision of an experienced instructor; builders or workmen may know little about bells, and should always be accompanied, even if visiting towers for purposes unrelated to the bells; and no-one should be in the tower alone.\nthere is further useful advice about tower management, health and safety, and fire risk assessment for bell towers within this \u0026lsquo;Running a Tower\u0026rsquo; document.\nWhat about Safeguarding? # Here are some helpful guidelines on safeguarding (CCCBR), but as a general rule each diocese issues its own guidance which will cover most bell-ringing situations. These issues cannot, of course, be dealt with fully in a brief text such as this. Your local ringing society will be able to give you more comprehensive advice, and can help, too, with any particular incidents or situations.\nSources of Help # The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers (Registered Charity number 270036) # Many pages of the website give information about all aspects of ringing (some of it\u0026rsquo;s a bit technical, but do persist). Alternatively you could contact the Council\u0026rsquo;s Honorary Secretary at secretary@cccbr.org.uk.\nYour local ringing society # Contact information for ringing societies. Your diocesan website will normally have links to the local ringing societies. Local associations usually have:\na Bell Adviser. an Education Officer. a Public Relations Officer. who will be able to offer advice or help.

The answers are based on Church of England practice, so may vary elsewhere across the world and denominations. The following was written by The Guild of Clerical Ringers, in 2020, and was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nGetting to know the people involved in the church where we ring # What is the difference between a vicar, a curate, an incumbent, a priest? # First of all, it is worth distinguishing between clergy status and clergy roles.\nThere are three levels of ordination:\ndeacon, a pastoral ministry; priest, a sacramental ministry; bishop, an oversight ministry. These titles are separate from any particular job or role.\nSecondly, there are many roles that clergy may take up. The titles for the roles are often historical, although may remain in use informally. Nearly all parish clergy are now ‘Priest-in-charge’. Cathedral clergy (‘Canons’ or ‘Prebendaries’) are led by a ‘Dean’ or ‘Provost’. Where parishes are grouped together, there may be a ‘Team’, overseen in some way by a ‘Team Rector’. There may be associate clergy, curates, chaplains and other particular titles. An incumbent holds a benefice, but these terms no longer have their original meanings. The easiest approach is to call them all ‘Vicar’ until they suggest their preference (such as ‘Father’). Better still is for ringers to get to know them well and be asked to use first name terms with the local clergy.\nWho is whose “boss”? # A person recently ordained in their post will have a vicar who oversees their parish training. Otherwise, the local priest, including assistant clergy, will have considerable freedom to manage the church and parish. The key to the local ‘boss’ is to find out who, apart from the parish priest, can and does chair the Parochial Church Council. Note that the PCC may delegate much of the business to a district church council.\nFor nearly all church activity, the vicar shares responsibility with the church council. The next management level is the Archdeacon, assisted locally by the Area (or Rural) Dean. The vicar is licensed by a Bishop, who has final (spiritual) authority but is very unlikely to intervene in parish management. A Suffragan Bishop is an assistant to the Diocesan Bishop.\nWhere do these people fit in - Churchwardens, verger ….? # Churchwardens are officers of the Bishop, elected by the parish, and play a significant role as set out in Canons E1 and E2 of the Church of England i.e. the “laws” of the church, as they are responsible with the vicar for much of what happens in a church, especially during a clergy vacancy. It is essential for ringers to know the Churchwardens and keep in communication with them.\nVergers, where they exist nowadays, ensure everything is in place for services. In cathedrals they may have a role in leading clergy in processions. In many churches, there is usually someone who looks after the building, locks and unlocks it, checks the heating and basic practical needs – a key person for ringers to befriend.\nWho should be responsible for the bells in our church? # Who owns them? # The legal ownership of the bells is vested in the Churchwardens. The PCC has a duty for the use, maintenance and insurance of the bells.\nWho should maintain the bells? # Ringers are well placed to maintain the bells in their tower. If unsure of the technical aspects of routine maintenance (such as checking ropes, replacing stays, greasing clappers, and so on), guidance is available from their association or guild officers, and from the CCCBR resources. However, they are acting for the PCC when carrying out routine maintenance on bells and ropes, and should keep a written record. The PCC should at least be kept informed of any maintenance being undertaken, and their permission sought for anything other than routine maintenance. Good communication between ringers and the PCC is essential, and reports should be submitted to the PCC to keep them informed. This will prevent any ill-advised or inappropriate work being done in the tower. An invitation from the PCC for the Tower Captain and / or Steeple Keeper to attend an appropriate part of PCC meetings is often a practical way of reporting and asking permission.\nWho pays for the new rope / pulley repair….? # While the PCC may be willing to fund such repairs, the likelihood is that the funds will not be readily available. If the ringers establish a fund for covering routine replacements, the PCC is likely to be grateful. Such a fund can be built up from fees from weddings and other services, donations from visiting ringers and similar sources. A parallel might be care of a pipe organ, which PCCs often find they cannot afford, the organ falling into disuse or being replaced by an electric key board. Funds for more major projects should be handled separately to ensure that the funds are handled optimally.\nCan we put up a new peal board? Who do we ask? # New peal boards need a Faculty, and ringers need to ask the PCC to approach the Archdeacon or Diocesan Registrar for permission. It need not be an arduous task.\nExisting peal boards must be cared for as historic artefacts. Information about the most recent changes to the Faculty process are available in Belfry Upkeep Faculty Rules.\nThe church handbells are locked in the vestry so no one uses them. Can the ringers borrow them? # Handbells require proper care, especially if they are of historic value. Communication between ringers and the priest or church wardens should resolve any problems or misunderstandings about the use of PCC property.\nIf there is a set of handbells anywhere, it needs to be recorded where the handbells are kept, particularly if they are in someone\u0026rsquo;s home, and also recorded if they are effectively the property of the ringers or PCC. Ringers should ensure that the handbells are recorded on the Church inventory. Experience shows that occasionally it has been thought they are the property of an individual ringer, and, on the ringer\u0026rsquo;s death, have been sold by the family. There have been some bitter disputes around the ownership of handbells.\n“Greattown” had a ringers’ service, how can we do that? # Suggest the idea to the local priest, with an outline of the service. Ringing Societies often hold such services as part of local meetings, and clergy will appreciate some guidance about content and experience elsewhere.\nIncluding some acknowledgement of ringers in a Sunday service, such as an introduction to ringers and ringing, or a dedication of some sort, is valued by both ringers and congregations. The Guild of Clerical Ringers is pleased to offer help.\nWe weren’t allowed to ring for the church fete because it would disturb the school band – aren’t we important as a church activity? # This is a matter of local consultation, and a willingness to work round the difficulties, such as coordinating the ringing and the band playing.\nHow can we talk about ringing to the children in the church school next door? # The CCCBR and the Association of Ringing Teachers provide resources and ideas for doing this effectively. The first step is to approach the Head Teacher, who may wish to check on the content and competence of any presentation. Being a church school does not mean that the church can insist on what happens within the school.\nThe new vicar wants more formality – ringers have never done this before! How do we - # Appoint a ringing master # Hold an AGM, chaired by the local priest or church warden, and elect the Ringing Master or Captain then. Ringers need to have confidence in the candidate, so previous discussion and agreement is important.\nHold an AGM # This is most important, as it ensures that the ringers are fulfilling appropriate governance, and in accordance with any PCC requirements. It also connects the ringers formally with the church leadership. Most important is that it acknowledges that ringing is part of the church life and mission.\nAll requests for visitors and extra ringing to the Parish office for agreement # Technically, ringing is by permission of the priest and PCC. However, arrangements are easier to manage if ringers deal with requests, but are mindful of accommodating local limitations, such as nearby businesses, meetings in church and services, always ensuring that the priest is aware of the arrangements. It is useful for visiting bands and special ringing to be booked in the church diary. There is a widespread requirement that visiting bands have, and abide by, safeguarding policies and requirements.\nWho decides the fee for ringing for weddings? # The PCC decides on all of the fees for weddings, and ringers need to make a case for the amount they need or wish for. It is worth noting that fees for ringing may differ between churches, even in the same area, reflecting different costs, such as travel and car parking, which are incurred by ringers attending.\nThe new PCC Chair has asked for … we have never needed to do this before! # Health and Safety, Risk Assessment, Emergency Plan # PCC requirements must be followed, and this list is important. For example, it ensures that the ringers are recognised for insurance purposes. Templates are readily available from ringing societies and church sources. Neighbouring towers may have good examples in place.\nList of members for GDPR # Each tower should surely have a list of its members anyway, if only for local association membership, and to maintain band identity and mutual support; while noting that members must provide their written permission (an email would be sufficient) if they are to be kept on a mailing list and for their names to be printed in any Annual Report produced. Examples of GDPR consent forms along with compliance details, etc. can be found variously online.\nSafeguarding, DBS checks # Safeguarding been shown to be of utmost importance. The Ringing Master or Tower captain must have received safeguarding training to the appropriate level, and in some towers, ringers are required or encouraged to achieve a lower level of training (online). Dioceses provide free training and advise on the appropriate levels required.\nDBS checks apply to the Ringing Master or Tower Captain.\nThe PCC is obliged to follow diocesan safeguarding policies, and this applies to ringers too.\nFurther information on all these topics is available within this document.\nWe want to restore our bells, update the ringing room, recruit more ringers # Restoration projects, Faculties and Fund raising # Detailed guidance is available on the Church of England website, along with further information about these FAQs\nThe Stewardship \u0026amp; Management Workgroup have produced Belfry Projects\nAdvertising for new ringers and training new ringers # The Association of Ringing Teachers has extremely useful material and resources to assist and encourage recruitment and training.

However, most of the principles addressed will apply to Churches of other denominations and bells outside church ownership and / or control, including those outside the UK. Where appropriate, advice relevant to the specific circumstances must be obtained.\nFundamentals of Insurance # There are various types of insurance:\nProperty insurance # aims to compensate if something we own and insure is lost or damaged (e.g. car, house, life). If we don’t have insurance for things we own, we are out of pocket if they are lost or damaged.\nLiability insurance # aims to compensate if we, as individuals, are legally responsible for loss or damage to someone else or their property (e.g. if a motor accident, or an injury to someone visiting us, is our fault). If we cause damage to others we are expected to pay compensation and can be taken to Court to make us do so. If we have liability insurance the insurer generally negotiates the settlement, pays for the damage on our behalf and, if we are taken to Court, defends the case and will pay the legal costs up to a limit for us as well.\nThe same principles apply to organisations such as companies, churches and ringing societies – they have assets that they can protect by insurance, and they can buy insurance against their potential liability to others.\nSome policies will cover property and liability. For example, comprehensive motor insurance covers both third party liability and damage to the car. House contents insurance covers the house contents, and may also cover the personal liability of all permanent members of the household to others arising from any accident anywhere in the UK, and sometimes overseas as well. Travel insurance normally covers loss of property, medical costs and personal liability.\nPersonal accident insurance # pays fixed benefits to the insured, (and not to the injured party. The insured may choose to pass on these benefits but is not bound to do so), for accidental death or specified injury, regardless of fault, and usually has a specified age range for covering people, ranging from 3 to 80. Outside of these ranges those insured under a policy would still be covered for any liability that they might either cause or incur.\nWhat Insurance Covers # With few exceptions, the law does not say what insurance policies must cover. Insurance policies are contracts – commercial agreements between consenting parties – and they cover what the parties (the people or organisations who sign the policy) agree they will cover. All policies have terms, conditions and exclusions, which the insurer must show clearly – so it is important that you read and understand them, before accepting the policy. This Guidance Note refers to what policies may cover, but each policy will be unique. Note that most policy documents will include two parts: the Schedule and the Policy itself. The policy is a more general document, which shows the range and detail of covers and the schedule details specifically what is covered for the person or organisation effecting the contract, e.g. who is insured and for what limits or sums insured.\nCover offered by private house contents insurance # If you have house contents insurance covering you and your family where you live, it is likely to include third party liability. You are covered if you cause any injury or damage to someone or something else or their property during your private or personal activities for which you can be proven liable. In all cases negligence has to be proven against you, but the insurer supports you in that process. The policy should cover many hobbies or activities, ringing included. Exclusions apply and you need to check these in the policy. There will be a limit of indemnity shown in the policy. Common limits are currently around £5 million, either per incident or in total. This may sound a lot, but it reflects the fact that liability damages can be huge. (If you were deemed negligent in causing injuries to a young person which meant they needed 24 hour care for the rest of their life, damages would be several million pounds. Similarly, if you were held to be liable for causing a fire that guts a church that could be expensive!)\nSome, but not all, house contents insurance policies also include an element of Personal Accident insurance. This is designed to provide income protection in the event that someone is unable to work as a result of an accident. If you are employed, your employer will usually provide such cover and there are requirements around statutory sick pay. For children and those who are retired there is little relevance. Equally, if individuals need this cover (e.g. if they are self-employed), then they must consider their own circumstances for everything they do, not just the low risk activity of bell ringing. (Most accidents occur on the road, in the kitchen or in the garden.) They should seek more bespoke cover if that provided does not suit or cover what they do for work or hobbies. However, generally extreme or dangerous sports, such as skiing and water activities may be excluded as standard.\nInsurance contracts usually specify geographical limits for the cover, commonly the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. If you travel outside these limits, additional travel insurance may be required to cover you while you are abroad.\nCover offered by church insurance # Every church should have its own insurance with cover provided defined in the policy. A typical Church policy includes several different types of cover, protecting the church if its property is damaged or its representatives injured, or if it is liable to compensate someone else for damage. The types most relevant to ringers include Personal Accident, Employers’ Liability and Public Liability.\nPersonal Accident cover provides a low level of compensation for church workers who are killed or injured while involved in the church activities. Note that church workers includes anyone employed by the church and volunteers involved in church activities. Because this is accident insurance, the church does not have to be at fault for this type of insurance to pay out. Typically, a church’s own ringers are included in this cover while they are ringing on behalf of the church, which would include service and practice ringing, and would be expected to extend to visitors who join practices or service ringing, as they are then ringing for the church. It is unlikely to cover the ringers when they are ringing elsewhere, unless they are clearly representing their home church, and it does not cover them when carrying out unrelated activities not for or on behalf of the church. It would probably not be considered to cover visiting ringers who are not ringing for that church (though if clearly representing their own home church, they may be covered by that) unless they were acting specifically on behalf of the church/PCC at their request.\nThis Personal Accident cover, is very limited and will not provide cover in all circumstances so if you need insurance against being killed or injured, you should make your own arrangements to cover your particular circumstances. The limits are likely to include age, the amount paid out and for how long. Any benefit is paid to the insured, who can decide whether or not to pass on this to the injured person.\nChurches also generally have liability insurance to protect the incumbent, PCC \u0026amp; Churchwardens (who have legal responsibilities) from any liability they may have to others arising out of the activities of the church. The typical policy offered to churches provides cover for claims against the church by other church workers, particularly church authorised volunteers (including ringers), and it also covers claims against the church arising from the actions of church workers on Church business. Church business would be expected to include ringing for services and practices, and routine maintenance such as stay replacement and muffle fitting. Typically, liability to church workers including the church’s own ringers is covered under an Employers’ Liability section of the policy, (which covers authorised volunteers), whereas liability to third parties and visitors is covered by a Public Liability section of the policy, but in either case the cover is there for cases where, because of a failure of care or negligence, the church has a legal liability for a loss suffered by someone else.\nDamage caused to third parties by people (such as ringers) acting on behalf of the church is covered under this type of policy, but it should not be relied upon to cover activities outside that church, unless they are clearly being carried out as representing that church. When ringers are away from their home church, they are not usually acting on its behalf, so the home church would not have legal liability for any damage that they cause.\nThe position is more complex in respect of liability for damage to the church or to third parties that is caused by visiting ringers. Such cases are very rare and whilst the church might have no legal liability for the damage, in practice the church’s insurer might well assist the church in managing the situation, even if ultimately a different insurer actually pays the claim based on the facts of the case.\nAs can be seen, whether ringers are considered to be ringing for a church when an incident occurs will be key to whether they are covered by accident or liability insurance. If in doubt, you could ask the PCC to confirm in writing that ringers are acting for the church. This might be possible for events such as ringing outings. However you cannot reasonably expect a PCC to give a blanket agreement that its church’s ringers are acting for that church whenever and wherever they carry out ringing-related activities, or that it accepts liability for the actions of visitors who are not acting for it though this should not be a barrier to the free movement of ringers between churches as it is more beneficial for churches to have their bells rung regularly, especially where there is no local band or is too small to raise enough ringers for events, such as weddings.\nInsurance for Tower Visitors who are not Ringers # Allowing members of the public into areas of the building that they would not normally visit exposes them to conditions which may be familiar to ringers but not to others, and this increases the risk that something will go wrong. The church, or a person in charge of the event, may be legally liable if this happens, so it is a matter of concern if the church insurance does not extend to cover events like this.\nOccasional visitors to the tower may be covered, but one off larger events such as open days may require specific cover, though this will generally be covered by the Church insurance if this is a PCC authorised activity. Some insurers publish guidance for churches about insurance for tower open days but it is important to ensure that the proposed event is clearly covered, if necessary with additional insurance for the specific event.\nInsurance for Handbells owned by Churches or Ringing Societies # Some churchesor Societies may own a set of handbells. Unlike tower bells that should be covered by the Church Buildings insurance policy, handbells should be included as part of the Property Contents section of the policy. It is essential that the Contents policy is sufficient, not least because nonringers negotiating the insurance policy may be unaware of the value of a set of handbells. Also note that there are limits to the sums of money that will be paid out in a single claim, for a single item, and in the period covered by the policy, so they must be set high enough to cover all the property insured. Ringers using the handbells should also check the policy for the cover offered. In particular, there are often clauses restricting cover when bells are stored or transported off the premises covered by the insurance policy.\nProviding evidence of insurance cover # Sometimes, visiting ringers are asked to provide evidence that they have insurance cover when they ask for permission to ring at a tower. This is becoming more common particularly as towers that are not in church control and / or ownership increases.\nThe first thing to note is that having insurance does not relieve the tower owner of any legal liability that it may have for its own negligence. Visitors are still protected for any damage that is found to be the fault of the church, owner or operator.\nHowever, damage or injury that is the visitors’ fault is potentially a personal liability of the visitors, and as such not covered by the church liability insurance. This is one reason why some owners of bells ask potential visitors to confirm that they have their own insurance cover, to demonstrate that they could pay for any damage that they cause to the church or to other people.\nIf a PCC does insist that visiting ringers confirm that they have liability insurance, (hopefully such instances should be rare,) please ask them to check with their insurer as to whether they are happy to cover the liability for visitors and ringers to the premises, including towers. As a public building, whose aim is to welcome all people you would expect the PCC to be happy to allow visiting ringers. As a rule the PCC would probably expect the tower captain or deputy to check whether the visitors are safe and suitable for the activity or ringing and that risk assessments are in place to control any issues that might arise.\nChurches not in church ownership and / or control # An increasing minority of bells hung for ringing are owned and / or controlled by a body other than a church in the Church of England. The Churches Conservation Trust and National Churches Trust may have similar insurance arrangements to churches. Several rings of bells are owned by local authorities.\nThese are likely to have rules requiring insurance when visitors are on their premises, and those rules are intended to cover all circumstances, so their requirements (particularly the amount of insurance required) may seem excessive for a ringing session. If you encounter this difficulty, asking to speak with the risk manager may be helpful in reaching agreement on what insurance (and how much) is really needed. A risk manager won’t necessarily be familiar with bells, but is trained to assess risk. It may be possible to demonstrate that personal insurance of the visitors is adequate to cover the likely cost of any damage that they might cause.\nThis complexity is increasing as more bells come under the care of authorities other than churches and the circumstances vary considerably.\nRinging Society insurance # Some Societies offer insurance to members but the cover provided varies from one society to another and the relevant version must be checked in detail. Societies should therefore consider publishing details of what insurance is in place in their annual report. From that members can understand what cover is provided which could benefit and protect them in the event of any incident involving a Society, and how they can report an incident or make a claim. Some include Personal Accident insurance as a benefit for members that would pay out if they are killed or injured while ringing. However, the level of cover is typically very limited and anyone who feels they need insurance for accidents should consider taking out insurance that will provide cover at all times, not only when ringing.\nSome societies have liability insurance in case the society or individual members are held to be legally liable for damage or injury they cause to others while carrying out ringing-related activities. It is important to ensure that the insurance includes what is called \u0026lsquo;member to member\u0026rsquo; cover, otherwise damage or injury suffered by other members will not be covered.\nAn society’s insurance policy will specify what it covers. It will not necessarily protect members (for accident or liability) at all times that they are ringing. Cover for accidental death or injury of members or for members’ liability may for example be restricted to when they are participating in ringing that is being run by the society, or to ringing at towers affiliated to that society (which may be relevant if your ringing activities straddle a border with another society’s territory). It may cover only members, or it may extend to learners under instruction. There may also be age restrictions (e.g. children and older adults), though these will not apply to Liability insurance.\nThe cover provided for members is usually agreed by the officers and is best considered for revision prior to the insurance policy being renewed (generally, annually). The broader the cover, then in general the more it costs, and the officers must weigh up the costs and the benefits. With annual society membership fees of only a few pounds per year, broad insurance is simply unaffordable.\nSome societies have been asked by their insurers to adopt policies relating to health and safety and risk assessment, and to designate an officer to oversee these matters. Such policies on health, safety and risk assessment need to cover the activities that are insured by the insurance policy (e.g., holding meetings or outings, or running ringing at society events). A policy on risk assessment is not the same as a risk assessment itself – it records the society’s attitude to health and safety and risk assessments, what it does to assess whether a risk assessment is needed, how it would perform one, and how it expects its members to act, if the cover extends to member liability. Some societies say they have been told they should buy Employers’ Liability insurance, as well as Public Liability. Even if a society has no employees, volunteers working under its authority and direct control are treated for some purposes as employees (for example in health and safety matters) so they might be excluded from some insurers’ standard Public Liability policies. To ensure they are covered, societies should confirm with the insurer that liability to and of volunteers is covered by the policy, or ensure that there is a separate Employers’ Liability section of the policy (like the church insurance described above) to cover volunteers.\nSocieties may also own property such as a Library, Masters Badge or handbells. These may be covered by Property insurance in the Contents section of a Policy. Members using the property insured (handbells, library items, masters badge) should check the policy for the cover offered. In particular, there are often clauses restricting cover when property is stored or transported away from the premises identified by the insurance policy. Typical clauses state requirements for storage out of sight, in a locked building or vehicle.\nThere are also limits to the sums of money that will be paid out in a single claim, for a single item, and in the period covered by the policy; these must be set high enough to cover the property insured. Periodic revaluation is necessary to make sure that cover is sufficient but not excessive: Consider a few scenarios:\nIf the library were destroyed, would it actually be replaced? Unique records, such as society minute books, are probably irreplaceable. The money spent on insurance may well be better spent on improved archiving and provision of duplicate and electronic copies of such documents.\nSimilarly, if your society is fortunate to own a very rare book, would one be obtainable as a replacement?\nConversely, a well-thumbed collection of copies of rather aged books that were lent to new learners but have not been used for many years or even decades, would probably not be worth replacing; more suitable up to date books are now bought by learners individually and extensive material is available on-line.\nA master’s badge, if it is of significant value, will be worth insuring as you would probably want to replace it if it were lost. However, if it is insured, make sure that it could be replaced by getting a specialist jeweller to make a proper record of it so that it could be reproduced. A specialist jeweller should also provide a valuation which would enable a claim to be made at an appropriate level, noting that the prices of precious metals fluctuate.\nIf you are an officer of a ringing society you may be personally liable if anything goes wrong relating to the operation of the society itself, particularly where the society or its bell restoration fund is a charity and you are a trustee. This liability might not be covered by other insurances that you have, or the society has. There is a form of insurance called Trustee Indemnity Insurance, which protects trustees against liability provided they have acted honestly and reasonably. A society may provide such insurance, alongside other types of insurance. Alternatively, individual trustees may wish to provide this cover for themselves.\nInsurance Implications of leaving Bells up # In some circumstances, there is a preference for bells to be left in the \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; position between ringing sessions. It should be noted that:\nRingers do not have absolute control of the access to bell towers. Control rests in part with the Incumbents and Church Wardens, but others have the right of access at all times. They include Officers of the Insurers, Architects, Fire Officers, maintenance and building workers, etc. It is not therefore possible for ringers to claim that no-one can go up the tower without their permission. In consequence, bells left in the \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; position represent a danger to any unknowledgeable person legitimately entering the tower and not under the supervision of the ringers.\nThough incidents or issues are infrequent, the risk of accidents or near misses is real. The consequences of such an accident can be catastrophic, resulting in death or very serious injury.\nWith the increasing tendency of people to go to litigation and the implications of the Health and Safety at Work Act, there is a risk of prosecution of church and tower officers by the HSE. One insurer provides specific guidance on this topic on their website\nThe notes indicate a general safe case, which should be interpreted to meet each unique local situation.\nInsurance during Installation, Restoration and Maintenance Work # Routine maintenance work performed by a ringer in their home church is likely to be covered by the church’s Personal Accident and Liability insurance. For a major project the position is complicated and you will need advice. Liability insurance is purchased to cover legal liabilities, and where the legal liabilityfor an incident lies is a question of law, not of insurance. It depends on who is doing the work, who has commissioned it and the relationships between the different parties involved. A person, who is not clearly acting as a volunteer or agent under the supervision of another body which accepts the legal liability in respect of what that person does for it, might be personally liable if an incident occurs. If they are representing a society, the society could be liable too. It is sensible on any major project to agree in writing who has the legal responsibility for the work and to check that they have the appropriate insurance to cover accidents and legal liability.\nSociety insurance may or may not include maintenance or restoration work, and there may be limits on the sort of work that can be carried out. If an society’s insurance cover does not include a particular type of work, the society is at risk if it participates in that type of project without first verifying that a different party is responsible for any liability and liability insurance.\nFor restoration projects where a commercial builder or bell hanger is carrying out the work, they may be able to include volunteers in their cover. However, experience suggests bell hangers will not cover any church volunteers under their insurance, so the tower captain would need to check whether the church insurance will accept any liability. If the PCC has commissioned the work the church’s insurance should cover other workers, such as volunteers. For DIY projects separate cover will probably be needed and can be very expensive, if cover is available at all. You may need to approach the church insurer, failing that an insurance broker or other expert to find an insurer to give this cover.\nAge restrictions apply with reduced Personal Accident benefits for youngsters and veterans, and an insurer could charge additional premiums, or even decline altogether, to insure legal liability if participants are outside age limits, because of the increased risk that they perceive with young or older participants.\nRemember, restoration work is much riskier than just ringing, where accidents are rare. As well as insurance, you will need to have someone in charge who is aware of the need to carry out risk assessments and to have firm rules for safety in place.\nWhy Insurance may not Pay Out # Most policies will include an “Excess” i.e. the sum of money which the insured party has to pay towards the cost of a claim.\nAny payment from insurance will depend on what type of insurance cover was agreed and the circumstances. Personal Accident insurance covers accidents, regardless of fault, but maybe there was no Personal Accident insurance in place that covered the injured person, or that covered the circumstances. A liability insurer on the other hand will not pay a claim unless the insured person was legally liable to pay for the damage – which usually requires them (or a person for whom they were responsible) to have been negligent and for the injury or damage to have occurred because of that negligence.\nSometimes no-one is legally liable. Accidents do happen. Sometimes people are responsible for their own injuries. No rule says that someone else must be liable for any accident. If someone is accused of negligence and their insurer thinks that person would be found liable in court, it will generally settle the claim. If it does not think so, it may if necessary defend the case in court on their behalf. Past court decisions guide insurers and courts on how to decide whether there is a valid claim, so many cases do not have to go to court, or are decided quickly if they do. Complex cases sometimes need to be heard in court to establish the facts, or a principle.\nInsurance and Guidance on Safety # Insurance is there to provide compensation when things go wrong. Safety and risk management aim to ensure that they don’t go wrong in the first place. Having insurance is no substitute for observing proper standards of safety and risk management, and if you have insurance you should take just as much care as if you didn’t have it. In fact you have an obligation to do so – an insurer may insist on explicit conditions of this nature when agreeing to provide insurance, and an insurer can in some circumstances refuse cover if the insured person was unduly careless. An analogy, is having a lifejacket on a boat - it is there and could be extremely useful if the boat sinks. However you don’t want the boat to sink, and you don’t want to do anything that makes it more likely to.\nChoosing an insurer # Insurance is provided by commercial companies and is therefore simply their business. Church related insurance is a specialist business and there are a few companies that have traditionally dominated this market and other providers are entering the market. As with any product, those paying for the insurance must balance the cost of the cover alongside the cover itself and the service offered by the provider. What may be attractive at the point of purchase may be less attractive if the insurer does not provide the cover you expected if compensation is sought, or they do not have appropriate expertise to defend you when required.\nAdditional Information # Some specialist insurance companies offer extensive guidance on their websites.\nReturn Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/docs/formalities/gdpr/","title":"Data Protection Guidance","section":"Formalities","content":" Data Protection Guidance # The following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website and was written in 2018.\nOverview # The GDPR was applicable in EU member states from 25 May 2018. It did not require national legislation to be implemented and when the UK left the EU, the GDPR - like other directly applicable EU legislation - became part of the UK’s domestic law under the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. The Data Protection Bill replaced the 1998 Data Protection Act (DPA), incorporates the GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive into UK law and deals with permitted derogations.\nThe GDPR is only concerned with personal data, i.e. any information related to an identified or identifiable living individual. It provides a more detailed definition than the DPA 1998, making clear that information such as an online identifier can also be personal data; reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people.\nThe GDPR has implications for Towers, Ringing Societies as well as the CCCBR.\nWhat is Different? # The GDPR introduced significant changes. However, the fundamentals remain broadly the same. The definitions are similar; the concepts of data processor and controller are retained; the data protection principles still apply but have been expanded to include transparency, data minimisation and integrity; and personal data and sensitive personal data (now referred to as special category data) have been expanded to include a broader definition of personal data and two new categories of ‘sensitive personal data’.\nThe GDPR retains the existing rights of data subjects and introduces enhanced rights including the right of ‘erasure’ (to be forgotten, although there can be compelling reasons to continue processing data), data portability and extended rights to object and be informed. Consent will become a restricted concept under the GDPR in that it must be freely given, specific, informed and an unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes. The Information Commissioner\u0026rsquo;s Office has published guidelines\nLegal Basis for Processing # For processing to be lawful under the GDPR, you need to identify a lawful basis. These are often referred to as the “conditions for processing” under the DPA. It is important that you determine your lawful basis for processing personal data and document this. Under the GDPR your lawful basis for processing has differing effects on individuals’ rights. For example, if you rely on someone’s consent to process their data, they will generally have stronger rights, for example to have their data deleted.\nThere are six lawful bases available for processing personal data:\nConsent of the data subject. Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take steps to enter into a contract. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation. Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another person Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of the data subject. There are 10 lawful bases for processing special categories of data (i.e. data relating to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, health, sex life or sexual orientation).\nIndividual Rights # Please refer to the ICO (Information Commissioner\u0026rsquo;s Office website) for further details.\nRight to be informed Right of access Right to rectification Right to erasure Right to restrict processing Right to data portability Right to object Rights related to automated decision making including profiling What Do You Need To Do? # If you have not yet looked into the GDPR, you should familiarise yourself in the first instance with the guidance published by the ICO.\nMost ringing organisations have now moved towards GDPR compliance over four phases:\nPhase 1 – Communication. Inform association officers of the changes to the legislation and their responsibilities. Phase 2 – Discovery. Conduct an “information audit” of personal data that your Society currently collects / processes / stores. Also look at your existing forms, consent wordings, privacy notices and the like. Document what legal bases you have for processing personal data. Phase 3 – Change. Devise new wordings for privacy notices and consent forms. Phase 4 – Embed. Ensure that your Society’s policies and procedures become embedded into routine practice. Things To Think About # Members # If you publish members’ personal data (e.g. name, address, email, telephone number) in your Annual Reports, newsletters or Society website, you need to have members’ explicit consent. The best way to achieve this is to use an appropriately-worded opt-in consent statement on your Society’s annual subscription renewal form. Membership Database # How is it stored? How secure is it? How do you back it up? How do you ensure it is up to date? What procedures do you have in the event of loss/corruption? What procedures do you have in place in the event of theft or data breach? What procedures do you have in place to track members’ data consent? Other ICT Considerations # Database and website security – security permissions and levels of access controlled by password. If members’ personal data is stored in the cloud, have you ascertained where in the world this storage exists? Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware is robust and up to date. Does your Society website have a GDPR-compliant Privacy Notice? Does your Society website use cookies? If so, are you compliant with “cookie law” by advising website users? Does your Society website use https or SSL? If your website includes any online forms, then using security certificates is highly recommended. Do you have members’ consent to publish their contact details on the Society website? Do you obfuscate members’ email addresses to prevent them being harvested? When emailing multiple members, do you use Bcc? Social Media # If your Society has a social media presence you must ensure that, as data controller, you do not infringe the data protection rights of any living individual. For more information, see also the CCCBR Guidance on social media. Financial Information # If you store members’ bank account details (e.g.: for direct debits etc), how are you securely storing and securely disposing of that information? Newsletters # If you publish photographs of individuals in your newsletters, do you obtain their consent? If you email newsletters to your members do you keep a record of when they “opted-in” to receiving the newsletter? Minutes of Meetings # Under GDPR, if people are named or referred to in minutes of meetings this is classed as personal data. Are minutes of meetings kept private and only circulated to those present? If minutes are in the public domain, do you need to seek consent from those present to publish them? Children # Children have the same rights as adults under GDPR. The GDPR contains new provisions intended to enhance the protection of children’s personal data. Where services are offered directly to a child, you must ensure that your privacy notice is written in a clear, plain way that a child will understand. Unless the child is deemed “competent”, a parent must grant consent for their child’s data to be collected, processed and stored. Third Parties # If you rely on any third parties for collecting, storing or processing personal data, have you established their GDPR compliance? Data Breeches # A personal data breach can broadly be defined as an incident that has affected the confidentiality, integrity or availability of personal data.\nWhen a personal data breach has occurred, you need to establish the likelihood and severity of the resulting risk to people’s rights and freedoms. If it is likely there will be a risk, you must inform the ICO within 72 hours of the breach being discovered; if you decide you do not need to report the breach, you should still document it.\nIn the event of a suspected breach of the Act the following should be addressed:\nContainment and recovery. Assessment of ongoing risk. Notification of breach. Evaluation of response. Top Five Tips # Here are the ICO’s “top five” data protection tips for small and medium sized charities and third sector organisations:\nTell people what you are doing with their data # People should know what you are doing with their information and who it will be shared with. This is a legal requirement (as well as established best practice) so it is important you are open and honest with people about how their data will be used.\nMake sure relevant society officers are adequately trained # Ensure that relevant society officers have a clear understanding of their responsibilities in terms of how they should store and handle personal information. Refresher training should be provided at regular intervals for existing officers.\nUse strong passwords # There is no point protecting the personal information you hold with a password if that password is easy to guess. All passwords should contain upper and lower case letters, a number and ideally a symbol. This will help to keep your information secure from would-be thieves.\nEncrypt all portable devices # Make sure all portable devices – such as memory sticks and laptops – used to store personal information are encrypted.\nOnly keep people’s information for as long as necessary # Make sure your Society has established retention periods in place and set up a process for deleting personal information once it is no longer required.\nFurther Advice # Data Protection: Parishes and GDPR GDPR for Small Chairities Return Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/docs/healthsafety/healthsafetypolicy/","title":"Health \u0026 Safety Policy","section":"Health \u0026 Safety","content":" Health \u0026amp; Safety # The following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nAdvice for Bell Ringers # This document aims to help bell ringing societies/guilds/associations prepare a Health and Safety Policy for all activities of the society.

While that is the focus of this document, the principles apply to rings of bells in towers owned by other organisations, in churches of other denominations, and churches elsewhere in the world. Local legislation and circumstances should always be considered.\nIn this document we provide guidance to ringers on how they can assist their church in the preparation and maintenance of an effective risk assessment for ringing and other activities in the church tower.\nThe control of hazards and risks is essential to secure and maintain a healthy and safe place to carry out bell ringing, but few churches were designed or built to comply with current legislation and many are extremely historic and vulnerable structures. Each church must be considered carefully and put in place its own relevant procedures and policies.\nResponsibility for Safety # The overall responsibility for safety and risk assessment in a church building rests with the tower authority. The church should have an overall Health \u0026amp; Safety Policy and Risk Assessment in place and should have appointed a \u0026lsquo;Responsible Person\u0026rsquo; to cover this.\nRingers have a responsibility to work with the tower authority, using their knowledge of ringing and bell installations to ensure that aspects of ringing and related activities within the tower are covered comprehensively. Ringers must behave in a safe manner while in the church and bell tower, respecting the requirements set down by the church authorities.\nSteps to Risk Assessment # The UK Health and Safety Executive identifies five steps forming a risk assessment.. These are:\nIdentify hazards. Assess the risks. Control the risks. Record your findings. Review the controls. The following sections describe these steps as applied to a church tower, combining steps 1 (identifying hazards) and 2 (assessing the risks).\nIdentifying Hazards and Assessing Risks # This must be carried out with the cooperation of the \u0026lsquo;Responsible Person\u0026rsquo; from the church and should involve both ringers and non-ringers (they will have different perspectives – a ringer may see something as ‘normal’ when it may represent risks for others). Remember that there may be other people involved who need access to the tower apart from the ringers: the clock winder perhaps, or the person who is responsible for the flag. Mobile telephone companies that use church towers for masts may need access at all times.\nAs a ringer, you will have one advantage: the tower is often self-contained with limited access, unlike the body of the church which may have a variety of furniture and fittings and much wider public access.\nWe suggest that your tower risk assessment should start at ground level including approaches to the tower entrance and go right up to the roof. Ringers may suggest that their responsibilities end at the bells but anyone who needs to go up to the roof will usually pass through the areas used most often by ringers so it makes sense to consider the whole tower.\nAs you proceed you must record any hazards and assess the risk that they pose to people or the fabric of the church. You will need to do this on a realistic ‘worst case’ basis: For example, some door catches may be slightly awkward. People may get used to them and not be concerned. But how would they cope in the case of a power cut or, worse still, in a fire?\nYou also need to consider unusual circumstances. For example, a tower or church Open Day where visitors may want to ascend the tower. Cases like this will require a specific risk assessment.\nWe list below possible hazards which you may encounter in various parts of the tower. These are illustrative, not exhaustive. It is your responsibility to help identify the hazards in the tower where you ring.\nAccess and Egress # These are more formal words for how you get in and out of the tower and ringing room, possibly under emergency conditions. In most churches, you will be going through doorways and, except for ground floor rings (which we will come to later), climbing stairs or ladders. You will need to consider:\nAre external paths, steps and doorways well-lit and in good condition, to avoid slips and trips? Are there suitable warning or information signs? Are all the doors (and trapdoors, in some cases) easy to open and close in an emergency? Are the floors and stairs in good condition, to avoid slips and trips? Is any part of the access constricted or with limited height? Is there a robust handrail? Is the lighting adequate and in good condition and are there emergency lights to illuminate and indicate the exit route in case of power failure? Are any ladders in good condition? Are there any ‘dead ends’ or doors that do NOT lead out of the exit door? As you leave, are the exits clearly marked? The overall security of the church and tower is important, to avoid theft, vandalism or possibly even terrorist action. You will need to consider:\nAre external doors well secured and resistant to forcing? Do the locks operate properly? Can they be opened and closed easily, especially in an emergency condition? Is the church locked with ringers inside on practice night, during quarter peals and peals? How then do they exit? How are keys controlled? Is the number limited and is a register of key holders maintained? Do church security, smoke and fire alarm systems extend throughout the tower? Remember that there may be hazards that are more visible on the way out than on the way in, and vice versa, so work carefully while going in and then out.\nRinging Room # The familiar term \u0026lsquo;Belfry\u0026rsquo; can be used to refer both to the room from which the bells are rung and the chamber where the bells are located. To avoid confusion, we will use the terms \u0026lsquo;Ringing Room\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Bell Chamber\u0026rsquo; respectively.\nThis is the room where ringers spend most of their time. It may be at ground level or upstairs. Familiarity means that some hazards may be overlooked, especially by the local ringers. But what about visitors, quarter peal and peal bands who are perhaps visiting the church for the first time?\nYou will need to consider:\nAre there slip and trip hazards from trailing electrical leads, boxes, uneven floors, mats, or general clutter? Is there a possibility of electric shock from damaged leads or defective portable or fixed electrical equipment? Are portable electrical appliance PAT tests carried out at the set intervals indicated and recorded? Are there enough power sockets? Or is there a tangle of extension leads? Is the lighting satisfactory? Is there emergency lighting and are exits illuminated and with correct signage? Is it tested routinely and records kept? Are there suitable fire extinguishers? Are they regularly inspected with appropriate records? Is First Aid equipment accessible for ringers? Is there an Accident Book available and are serious accidents reported to the tower authority? Are tower contact details clearly displayed for use in case of emergency? Are emergency exit routes clearly marked? How would emergency services be called, and how would they locate and access the tower and ringers? Are there appropriate alert notices about clock chimes and clock hammers? Are ringing and non-ringing visitors met and welcomed to the tower and advised on specific local risks, for example more difficult bells? Moving bell ropes present a hazard:\nAre the ropes maintained to minimise the chance of a broken rope? Are all ringers instructed in the disciplines of remaining still when not ringing and not to cross the circle while ringing is in progress? Are learners properly supervised? Are the rope paths clear of items around the ringing room? Consider statues, furniture and items stored by other users, especially in ground floor rings. Remember that learners may not keep as straight a rope as more experienced ringers. Are bell ropes when not in use placed on a spider and hoisted clear and secured, with signage in place to indicate if the bells are \u0026lsquo;up\u0026rsquo;? (Do not use notices saying that the bells are \u0026lsquo;down\u0026rsquo; as these may be left in place by mistake and discourage ringers from checking before attempting to raise a bell.) The most likely mechanical issues to have effect in the ringing room are a broken stay or rope, or a ringer losing control of the rope:\nAre the stays inspected regularly to detect incipient cracking? Are all ropes checked regularly for wear? Are learners instructed in the action to be taken in the event of a broken rope, missed sally or broken stay? Are there any objects in the ringing room which could be caught by a flailing rope? It is general practice for bells to be left in the \u0026lsquo;down\u0026rsquo; position when not in use. There may, however, be local circumstances which require bells to be left in the \u0026lsquo;up\u0026rsquo; position. Ecclesiastical Insurance published a note on conditions of use applying to change–ringing bells. This states: From a health and safety perspective it is extremely hazardous for bells to be left ‘up’ particularly if fire fighters or others need to enter the tower or if unauthorised persons, including children, interfere with the ropes.\nIf this is the case in your tower you should prepare a specific risk assessment. Guidance on what to do if the bells are left \u0026lsquo;up\u0026rsquo; is provided in the Ecclesiastical document.\nBell Chamber # This room is a high-risk area, with multiple trip hazards, risks of falling and danger from moving bells.\nIf any major works are to be carried out in the bell chamber you are strongly advised to prepare a specific risk assessment.\nFor more regular inspections and minor works you need to consider:\nHow is access to the bell chamber secured? How is access limited only to people who have authority for access? How are those permitted access, advised of the risks and demonstrated to be competent? How are they equipped with suitable protective clothing? What are the arrangements to eliminate, or at least control, lone working in the bell chamber? Is there adequate lighting? Is the floor under the bells kept clear of oily rags and accumulations of dust? Do any of your bells go up \u0026lsquo;wrong\u0026rsquo; and require manual turning of the clapper? Ecclesiastical Insurance published a relevant note on conditions of use applying to change–ringing bells.. Other Areas within the Tower # There may be intermediate rooms in the tower in addition to the ringing room and bell chamber. If between the two, then the ropes will pass though during ringing.\nYou need to consider:\nIs access to these spaces secured during ringing? Is anything stored in these spaces which could interfere with the ropes? Such a room may house the church clock. Are the clock winders and other persons aware of possible hazards? Special Considerations for Ground Floor Rings # Ground floor rings are usually found at one end or one side of the church, although some are in the body of the church, particularly where there is a central tower. This arrangement avoids many of the problems of access up a staircase, but it can introduce other hazards.\nYou need to consider:\nThe ringers may share their accommodation with a choir vestry or the tools for churchyard maintenance. This raises risks which can only be controlled by discussion and cooperation with the other users of the area. Ropes must be hoisted up and secured when not in use. Other church users or casual visitors must not be able to enter the rope circle during ringing. Outward-facing warning notices must be displayed during ringing and all the ringers must understand that ringing could be stopped immediately if circumstances demand. During some ringing - perhaps a peal for a special occasion - it may be necessary to lock the church or position stewards in the area. Controlling Risks # You will now have a long list of potential hazards and risks. You may be worried about this, or you may have already started to see ways in which the hazards can be addressed in order to bring the risk to an acceptable level. Towers vary so we cannot tell you how to deal with every hazard or risk but we will give you some ideas about what may need to be managed by the tower authority or ringers. Remember the \u0026lsquo;ALARP\u0026rsquo; principle as applied to risks: \u0026lsquo;as low as reasonably practicable\u0026rsquo;.\nThe basic need is to establish and maintain a culture of safety and good housekeeping that is respected by all members from the Tower Captain to new recruits and communicated to visitors, both ringers and non-ringers. Remember that \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo; has been defined as the way that people behave even if they think nobody is watching them.\nIn many cases hazards can be eliminated by simple actions. For example:\nA defective electric fire can be repaired or replaced by a new one. The ringing room is kept clean and tidy, and free of unnecessary items. Modifications, some of them expensive, may be required:\nLocks may need to be changed, or new padlocks purchased. Handrails may need to be fitted on stairs. Work by professional contractors may be needed on the electrical installation. Procedural controls may be possible. These are where we ask people, both ringers and visitors, to behave in a safe and responsible way. Such controls can be enforced by instruction and warning notices but, most of all, you need careful explanation to ensure that all members of the band, plus visitors and any new recruits, understand why these actions are necessary. Examples are:\nRespecting the need to remain seated and legs uncrossed with feet on the floor while not ringing. Respecting restrictions on who is allowed in the bell chamber. Establishing and maintaining requirements on teaching learners, identifying who can provide teaching and the precautions to be taken, especially with minors. Hazards arising from the bell installation, most notably a broken stay or rope, are controlled by a comprehensive programme of maintenance. For more serious problems, or if none of your ringers have maintenance experience, you should contact your local ringing society, or a professional bell hanger.\nWhere a bell is prone to going up \u0026lsquo;wrong\u0026rsquo; it may be possible to remove the hazard by a hardware solution. Possibilities are:\nModifications to the clapper geometry. Fitting a wooden-shafted clapper. Using a clapper turning mechanism operated remotely from the bell. All of these solutions will require assistance from professional bell hangers or other experts. If none of these solutions is possible a specific procedure should be prepared. This should include two persons being present in the bell chamber.\nOpening a tower to parishioners and other members of the public is an excellent way of informing people about ringing (and a good day out). But it can pose challenges: The suitability of the access route, the condition of staircases, steps and handrails and the adequacy of any lighting, to name only a few. This is a case where a specific risk assessment should be carried out. Ecclesiastical Insurance issued guidance on Tower Tours.\nRecording Findings # When the activities above are complete the results should be recorded. There are many formats available on-line. Ecclesiastical Insurance issued one on risk assessment (small church).\nAn example document can be downloaded here.\nYou are at liberty to use your own format, tailored to fit your needs. But you should cover the following points:\nIdentification of the hazard. The consequential risk. What is already being done to control the risk. What further action is needed, if any. Who is responsible for carrying out any further action. An agreed date for completion of any further action. Date of completion of any further action. The document should also record who carried out the assessment and any further actions, and the acceptance by the tower authority.\nThe tower authorities will be producing a risk assessment for the rest of the building and the assessment for the tower will normally form part of that and may follow their format.\nThis assessment must be communicated to the rest of the band. Where possible, they should be involved in the completion of any actions arising. The document should be readily available and key points made known to new recruits and visitors. The risk assessment will be useful only if all members take ownership of the findings.\nReviewing Controls # Finally, the assessment must be a \u0026rsquo;living document\u0026rsquo;. It should be reviewed regularly (probably annually) and certainly after any changes to the building or the personnel. The review dates should be publicised and adhered to. The review should involve all members, who may point out problems, accidents or near misses which might require modification to the document.\nUseful Information # You may wonder why we did not offer this information right at the start. Well, we think that starting off by ploughing through this information would be enough to put you off the whole idea. But there is useful information here and the time to use this information is when you have understood the challenges in your own tower. The sources below may highlight things you have missed and may help you with identifying suitable controls. You should also consider the list of general safety principles given in the appendix to this document.\nThe UK Health and Safety Executive and Ecclesiastical Insurance Group provide extensive risk management information, that from Ecclesiastical being more relevant to churches and ringers.\nThe CCCBR have published various guidance documents. These cover church tower access, lighting in and around towers, fire safety and risk assessment, and lightning protection. These will gradually be incorporated into this \u0026lsquo;Running a Tower\u0026rsquo; document.\nART: excellence in ringing teaching, Association of Ringing Teachers. provide advice and assistance on teaching ringing.\nAppendix # General Principles for Safety in the Bell Tower # This list is intended to help you and the tower authority to spot hazards and identify controls. Please do not think that you can complete a risk assessment just from this list. Your assessment should be based on the tower where you ring and an assessment of risks and mitigations.\nA clean and tidy environment must be maintained within the tower. This is more likely to be achieved by encouraging a \u0026rsquo;tidy culture\u0026rsquo;, rather than by irregular massive clean ups. Adequate space is provided for hanging external clothing. Large items such as luggage, backpacks and pushchairs are not brought into the ringing room. Tower contact details (postcode, what3words reference) are clearly displayed in case of emergency. The Ambulance and Fire Service may be required to extract an injured person from the tower. The name of each person entering the tower and during ringing is recorded, with date, time of arrival and departure. This acts as a record for safeguarding purposes and as an aid for emergency services in the event of a need to evacuate the area. All the electrical equipment and fittings are safe and tested. Extension leads are not \u0026lsquo;daisy chained\u0026rsquo;. Lighting is adequate and reliable and includes emergency lighting inside the tower and along emergency exit routes. Heaters and other electrical equipment are in date for PAT tests, safe and switched off when not in use (equipment switch and wall socket both off, plug out). Fire extinguishers suitable for the hazards present are visible and checked at the set intervals (they are easily overlooked if behind closed doors or upstairs). Rope warmers are appropriately designed, tested and use low powered heating elements, not filament bulbs. All doors and trapdoors work smoothly and locks are secure. A route is available for emergency evacuations, including when the church is otherwise closed. All keys are limited to those that need them and a register of keyholders is maintained. All ringers and visitors are briefed and understand the principles of belfry discipline. Only those with specific authorisation can access the tower and bells. Any other visitors are escorted. Bell ropes are not accessible to people without permission. Learners are taught and accompanied only by experienced ringers. Minors are escorted by a parent or guardian. The Tower Captain is usually elected by the ringers with the appointment approved by the tower authority. The Tower Captain and other officers are aware of their responsibilities. Bells are left down when not being rung unless there is a justifiable reason for some or all to be left up. If left up, this is clearly indicated in ways that make the risks understandable to non-ringers. The ringing room and bell chamber are not accessible to unauthorised people. Anyone entering the ringing room can tell immediately if anyone is working in the bell chamber. Work in the bell chamber is controlled: At least one of those present is qualified and authorised. There is no lone working, although a trained and authorised person can work alone when someone else is in the tower and the two are in communication. An example would be adjusting the length of bell ropes. Bells are down while work is being carried out in the bell chamber unless it is essential to carry out checks on a moving bell (for example, to check for binding after replacing a stay). In that case a specific risk assessment is carried out. Bells and fittings are regularly inspected and maintained by competent personnel, with records kept. A comprehensive procedure is in place for when the tower is open to non-ringing visitors.

This could concern a single bell, manual chimes or change ringing bells. The notes were first compiled to aid ringers to return to towers to ring bells when restrictions due to Covid-19 were eased, but are applicable after other periods of non-use for whatever reason. The notes may assist the tower authority and bell ringers; they do not intend to provide comprehensive information about health and safety or risk assessments generally.\nAlthough this document may look long, the time taken to make the checks will not be time-consuming if the bells and associated installation were maintained in good condition and rung frequently (a few times a month) until ringing stopped. The longer ago that ringing was stopped and any maintenance was done, then the more thorough the checks required. A few key items may have occurred regardless of when the bells were last rung.\nA risk assessment of the tower and bells will form part of the risk assessment for the whole building.\nThe risk assessment will be completed by the Responsible Person appointed by the tower authority and it is advised that one or more experienced ringers assist with this. The whole risk assessment should be recorded, dated and reported to the tower authority. Remedial work should be undertaken by competent people. Ringers are advised to check that the actions are completed before ringing commences. Belfry Upkeep may be used as an aide memoire for undertaking basic maintenance checks.\nNote that any work to bells, other than what is deemed to be minor maintenance should be done with the correct permissions and faculties in place, and in accordance with all relevant health and safety policies. Advice on faculties is available within Belfry Upkeep. Few towers were designed or built to comply with current legislation and many are extremely historic and vulnerable structures.\nRingers may be in buildings at times when the building is otherwise unoccupied, and also in parts of the building that are separate and less accessible from the rest of the building.\nEach building and tower has to considered carefully and have in place specific procedures and policies that are suitable.\nMost towers with rings of bells are within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. These notes focus on these but the issues are likely to apply to bells in towers owned by other organisations, in churches of other denominations, and also churches elsewhere in the world. Local legislation and circumstances should always be taken into account.\nResponsibilty for Safety # It is important to note that the responsibility for health and safety and risk assessment rests with the tower authority. It is best that one or more experienced ringers work together with the tower authority to prepare the risk assessment and that it is dated. Normally, in a church, the Incumbent should have appointed a Responsible Person for health and safety matters. Ringers need to use their experience and knowledge of ringing and bell installations to assist the tower authority in carrying out and implementing risk assessments within the tower.\nIssues to Consider # This document is in two parts:\nThe first part covers some issues that should be considered when carrying out a risk assessment prior to conducting checks of the conditions of the bells and their installation in a tower after period of non-use (typically 3 months or more). This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, nor is it suitable or relevant for every tower; it is intended as a guide for those involved to consider the hazards that may be present in their own tower. The second part is a brief list of things that should be checked as part of a pre-ringing inspection. Again, it is not an exhaustive list but covers the main points. Each installation may have its own idiosyncrasies that require specific consideration and attention. The tower authority may have its own Risk assessment recording sheets; a tabular format is recommended.\nReturn Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/healthsafety/fireprevention/","title":"Fire Protection","section":"Health \u0026 Safety","content":" Fire Protection and Risk Assessment # The following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nIntroduction # These notes offer advice about specific issues that may affect bell ringers and the bell tower when considering fire safety and fire protection. The notes may assist the tower authority and bell ringers; they do not intend to provide comprehensive information about fire protection and fire risk assessments more generally. Few towers were designed or built to comply with current legislation and many are extremely historic and vulnerable structures. Ringers are often in towers at times when the building is otherwise unoccupied, and also in parts of the building that are separate and less accessible from the rest of the building.\nMost towers with rings of bells are within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. The notes therefore focus on these but the issues are likely to apply to rings of bells in towers owned by other organisations, in churches of other denominations, and also churches elsewhere in the world. Local legislation and circumstances should always be taken into account.\nFigure 1 (left): Fire at Leighton Buzzard. Figure 2 (right): the aftermath.\nFires may start anywhere in the building and for a variety of reasons: electrical faults, in kitchen areas, lightning strikes, accidents especially during building work, or arson. A church can act as a chimney and help draw a fire up. Regrettably fires can and do occur in towers, examples within the recent past include:\nCoventry Cathedral (1940), church destroyed by bombing but tower and bells remain. Yateley (1979), tower restored with recast bells. York Minster (1984), bells not affected. Leighton Buzzard (1985) church and tower gutted, new ring installed. Buckfastleigh (1992), church destroyed but tower and bells remain unaffected. Royston (2018), church destroyed, Tower restored with recast bells. Responsibilities # There are legal requirements In England and Wales the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 came into effect in 2006 and applies to all buildings other than domestic dwellings. Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate legislation that is very similar. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government provides full details and guidance on this on their website (applicable in England and Wales). Ringers should comply with the relevant legislation that is applicable in their local area.\nThe Fire Safety Order puts duties on persons who are in control of premises (defined as \u0026lsquo;responsible persons\u0026rsquo;). Whilst in most churches the PCC, as a body corporate, will be the overall responsible person, ringers (whether locals or visitors) often have sole responsibility for what takes place in the belfry and ringing room. They should therefore co-operate with the tower authority to ensure safety.\nThe PCC has ultimate responsibility for the care and maintenance of all church buildings and their contents, including fire protection and safety. These responsibilities are usually executed by the churchwardens.\nThe tower authority should prepare an Emergency Plan as part of the Risk Assessments and Emergency Plans. This is prepared by the tower authority, in conjunction with ringers and provides information about what should be done in the event of emergencies and other incidents, including fire.\nThe value of emergency planning was demonstrated during an incident (not fire related) as recounted by Phillip Orme in The Ringing World in January 2020 (issue no. 5673)\nThe tower authority will appoint a person to be the lead for building safety. They, working with others as necessary, will conduct a Fire Risk Assessment. The assessment will identify any physical and operational changes needed to make the building comply with legislative requirements.\nThe Tower Captain or another competent person (I.e. with good knowledge of the tower, bells and bell ringing) should assist with the Fire Risk Assessment. They should ensure that all aspects of access to the tower and the bells by ringers are considered and that any changes proposed are appropriate for ringing and ringers, and subsequently implemented.\nThe tower authority should ensure that the ringing master and deputy are fully familiar with fire safety procedures for ringers and the bells.\nThe \u0026lsquo;responsible person\u0026rsquo; has a duty to ensure that ringers and visitors know what they should do to prevent fires and what to do if one should break out while they are in the building. They should ensure that \u0026lsquo;reasonable and practicable\u0026rsquo; fire safety precautions are implemented and reviewed periodically to ensure that they are still applicable, particularly after any alterations to the building and/or ways of operating.\nThe Assessment # The risk assessment for the tower and ringers should be an integral part of the church Risk Assessment. It is a written document retained in the building, with a copy available for tower users. It should refer to all parts of the tower, i.e. the access and staircases, in the ringing room, intermediate spaces and bell chamber.\nTo reduce the risk of fire, you need to eliminate one or more of the following ingredients depicted in the \u0026lsquo;Fire Triangle\u0026rsquo;:\nHeat or cause of ignition. Fuel as combustible material. Oxygen, normally from air. Figure 3: The fire triangle\nThe Tower Captain and/or Steeple Keeper should accompany the Responsible Person while they prepare the Risk Assessment in the tower systematically. Here we highlight specific factors that are likely to be important for ringers and in the tower in the course of undertaking the risk assessment:\nIdentify Fire Hazards # E.g. old/poor electrical installations and equipment.\nIncreasingly, ringers bring more electrical devices into ringing rooms including heaters, phone chargers, rechargeable lights, computers, rope warmers, cameras, kettles, etc. Heaters should ideally be installed as permanent fixtures, rather than portable equipment. All additional electrical items should be \u0026lsquo;PAT\u0026rsquo; tested (Portable Appliance Testing) as items on the inventory of building electrical equipment. The use of additional items of electrical equipment also leads to the proliferation of multi socket extension leads, which themselves can pose additional risks of electrical overload and overheating. If they are essential, follow the instructions for their use keeping within the limits specified and not \u0026lsquo;daisy chained\u0026rsquo;. Only electrical equipment serving a specific need should be left running while the tower is unoccupied, all other equipment should be turned off fully (on/off switch located on the equipment turned to off, wall switches off and plugs out).\nRemove as much combustible material such as paper, boxes, ropes, overalls for maintenance work, etc.. Items for use should be kept compact and tidy.\nFlammable materials such as paint, oils, lubricants, etc., should not be stored in the tower whether for use by ringers or other building users.\nIdentify People at Risk # The local band of ringers and other regular tower users (e.g. clock winder) all need to be considered but also consider visitors, and members of the public, who may visit the tower on open days, or for clock and other maintenance work.\nEvaluate, Remove, Reduce, Protect from Risk # A periodic clean up and tidy up is essential, but ensure that what may appear to be \u0026lsquo;junk and rubbish\u0026rsquo; papers are not historic records and valuable tower or even local society assets! Store valuable artefacts securely, perhaps in a secure archive facility – if there were to be a fire how would they be replaced?\nRecord, Plan, Inform, Instruct and Train People # Remove or reduce the risks identified to a \u0026lsquo;reasonable and practicable\u0026rsquo; level.\nReview Regularly # The risk assessment should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it is kept up to date, with changes made as appropriate.\nExamples of actions that may be taken # Fire Detection and Warning Systems # These should be installed, maintained and tested periodically as part of the building systems and cover the tower to the highest levels.\nSmoke/fire detectors at each level of the tower and in the staircase. Fire bells and flashing lights are used in new installations – check that they are audible and visible even when the bells are being rung. Some buildings still rely on voice alerts – although this is acceptable and may be adequate for a ground floor ring, would a voice be audible above the noise of the bells being rung, several floors up a tall tower? Equipment # Extinguishers suitable for the hazards in the area should be provided at all levels in the tower. Sprinkler systems may be installed in some larger buildings. These will be provided as part of the building equipment, maintained and tested periodically. It is common for extinguisher systems in the tower to be overlooked or inaccessible during inspection visits!\nFire doors are not often installed in older buildings but even a poorly fitting door kept closed may reduce smoke ingress and slow the progress of a fire through a tower.\nEvacuation Procedures # Fire evacuation routes should be as short as possible, with ideally more than one route available. This however, is rarely feasible in towers so additional fire detection and resisting systems should be installed through towers. In the extreme, consideration may be given to how ringers could be rescuedfrom the tower roof or through a tower window, even through the trap door in the floor. Such extreme arrangements should be planned and in all likelihood rehearsed with the local fire and rescue services, before being accepted as a realistic option.\nStaircases and doorways should be kept clear of obstructions and materials that could cause or assist the spread of fire.\nBattery powered lighting should be available, ideally as part of the building installation. There is now a range of rechargeable torches that can be kept charged and made available when required. Make sure that there is sufficient to meet the needs of the number of ringers likely to be in the tower. Torches are also useful outside the building and for use in the muster/assembly point.\nEmergency evacuation routes should be marked clearly using (preferably) illuminated signs in the standard pattern.\nFigure 4: Standard exit sign\nRemember that all building doors may be locked securely when ringers are in the tower, but make sure that there is a means of opening emergency exits quickly. Several mechanisms may be considered depending on local constraints, particularly maintaining security e.g. a key in a box behind a glass panel, or a \u0026lsquo;push bar to open\u0026rsquo;.\nTowers often have various doors, cupboards, passages etc. that do NOT lead to a way out of the building. It should be made clear, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the building, which will and which will not offer a way out in an emergency. Additional arrangements should be considered for towerusers who are less mobile; advise them specifically when arriving at the building.\nThe muster/assembly point for the building will be slightly away from the building. Its location should be indicated at all exits. At some buildings, the ringers’ exit from the tower may not be the same as doors used by the majority of the building users.\nRingers should also be reminded that they should not park vehicles where several large emergency vehicles may require access, even when there are no other users in the building at the time.\nTraining and Advising Ringers and Tower Users # Ringers using the tower whether on a regular basis or as visitors should be made aware of the building Emergency Plans and know the procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or other emergency incident. Ringers should be included in routine emergency evacuation practices. Normally, the Tower Captain should trained to act as a marshal to guide people out of the building in the event of an emergency. Their responsibilities in the event of emergencies should be included in their letter of appointment from the tower authority.\nHowever, it is quite usual for ringers to be let into a tower then left to ring with few or none of the local ringers present, whether for a short visit or a quarter peal lasting about an hour, or even a peal lasting 3 hours or more. The visitors should be briefed fully, ideally with information in writing, about emergency arrangements, especially if the building is otherwise unoccupied.\nA record of who is in the tower, with names and time of entry and time of leaving is an essential aid for emergency service workers. They should then know the number of people at risk and reduce risks to themselves and the building by wasting time searching unoccupied space needlessly.\nFinal comments and further information # Risk assessments and fire protection in towers should be considered by the ringers in conjunction with the Responsible Person for the building concerned. Those responsible should have the necessary knowledge and information about what is required legally and to comply with local arrangements. It should not therefore be necessary for ringers to find information for themselves.\nThe legal requirements, advice, guidance on risk assessments, etc. are available on various websites including the Church of England, insurers such as Ecclesiastical, and the UK Government Health \u0026amp; Safety Executive. Professional advice should only be obtained from a competent fire risk assessor, who should be a member of a Professional Body Person Registration Scheme (e.g. Institute of Fire Prevention Officers (IFPO), Institute of Fire Safety Managers (IFSM) or Institution of Fire Engineers (IFE)).\nSpecific UK Government web sites offer information about risk assessments in buildings:\nSmall and Medium places of assembly Large places of assembly The Institution of Fire Engineers have a specialist interest group for heritage buildings and have produced guidance on \u0026lsquo;Fire Safety for Traditional Church Buildings\u0026rsquo;\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source 1 Leighton Buzzard fire Photo: Mark Regan 2 Leighton Buzzard bell chamber after the fire Photo: Mark Regan 3 The fire triangle 4 Standard exit sign Return Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/healthsafety/security/","title":"Security","section":"Health \u0026 Safety","content":" Security of Towers and Bell Ringers # The following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nIntroduction # These notes are written to help bell ringers consider their own security and that of the towers that they occupy when ringing. The principles underlying these notes apply to many buildings regardless of function or ownership, and activities. Here we highlight factors that relate specifically to ringers and ringing, rather than those that are more generic. References are drawn from those defined for the Church of England and the UK. Two main topics are included: Crime and Terrorism\nThreats from Crime # As owners, tower authority (in churches the Incumbent, PCC and Church Wardens) have formal responsibility for ensuring that buuilding and tower security procedures are in place but it is the responsibility of both owners and users - as individuals and organisations - to ensure that procedures are set up and followed.\nProcedures must be realistic and proportionate. It is very important that ringers (probably the Tower Captain and/or Steeple Keeper) liaise with the tower authority to discuss and draft security procedures.\nSome basic security awareness can help ringers to protect churches, towers and bells. The Church of England provides useful guidance including some top tips for prevention.\nInsurers such as Ecclesiastical Insurance (EIG) provide guides for a range of church building crime and security matters including a check list.\nArrangements will always depend on the specific building, situation and local environment, such as -\nsize and design. ground floor ring or not. urban/rural location. isolated or overlooked. and may differ during daylight and after dark. Since ringers will need access to the tower, perhaps by a different entrance and at different times from the majority of building users, they need to make sure that security and crime prevention arrangements are compatible with their specific requirements.\nProcedures for lone working, and for first person in and last person out, are worth defining explicitly.\nRingers often access parts of a building that are not often visited by others, so they may be able to spot disturbance, unusual objects and occurrences that would not readily be seen by other users.\nMetal theft, particularly of lead roofing, brasses and small bells (even larger bells), is attractive to thieves.\nRingers need to:\nBe aware of the procedures and practices, with training and updating, ideally including exercises. Inform the tower authority when ringers will be in the tower, especially at times that are not routine. The following points are specific topics for ringers to consider with the tower authority:\nKeep Doors and Windows Locked # High quality locks, meeting current industry standards, are advised for all accessible doors and windows, including those into and through the tower. Remember that even doors and windows that are not normally accessible may still be reached from a ladder or platform, or while scaffolding is erected. Security products supported by the police can be found here. Specialist companies will advise on what is appropriate as not all will be suitable for fitting to historic fabric and specific permission may be required for their installation. Locks on intermediate doors on staircases will provide additional security and prevent access to the bell chamber, particularly while the bells are up. Doors and windows, their frames, hinges, latches, etc. should be able to withstand any attempts at forcible entry. Only a minimum number of the band should be key holders for the tower, ringing room and bell chamber. Ringers should consider how the building is secured once they are inside, e.g. for practices. How will late arrivals gain access and how may ringers be contacted (above the noise of bells being rung)? A warning light and/or specific agreed hand signal may be appropriate. Clear directions need to be displayed in the tower for how to direct emergency services to the tower and gain access. A postcode may not be sufficiently precise so \u0026lsquo;what3words\u0026rsquo; may also be helpful. Arrangements need to be made so that ringers can access other facilities such as toilets, first aid and emergency equipment, etc., even while the rest of the building is locked and alarmed. Keep Keys Safe # Physical keys and key codes must be kept secure, ideally not on the premises, even if considered to be \u0026lsquo;hidden\u0026rsquo;. Have a secure key register, usually retained by the tower authority, recording name and contact details of those holding keys to the bell tower, with period checks of holdings. Keys and codes should not be copied or shared further. Define a process in case keys or codes are lost. Protect High-Value Items # Identify and keep an inventory, with photos, serial numbers, etc., of high value items in the tower. Mark items visibly or invisibly, as long as marking does not compromise the object, particularly if it has historical significance. Do not leave money in the tower. Handbells, computers, trophies and other valuable and/or attractive items must be properly secured, out of sight, and with appropriate insurance. Consider the security of other items of little monetary value that are in the tower, but are of historic interest or use to ringers such as peal books, registers, records and other artefacts. Consider the Security of Ringers, Visitors and their Property # How secure are car parking and cycle racks? Ringers may wish to consider where they leave their car or cycle. How are the credentials of visitors checked to ensure that they are bona fide? Ringers may visit a tower for a practice unannounced and there may even be other visitors or deliveries. Good communication will help prevent awkwardness if access were to be denied or allowed inappropriately. Alarms and CCTV need to cover all levels of the tower. Security patrols, for example in larger churches and cathedrals, should also consider these areas. Can alarms in the tower be isolated during ringing, leaving the rest of the building alarm active? Alarm (de)activation must be controlled in the same manner as locks and keys. Are tools and other items such as ladders or flammable materials that could be exploited by criminals, minimised or secured appropriately? Are all paths, steps and doorways used by ringers well lit? Are hiding places for people or objects minimised? Consider carefully what information is provided on notice boards, magazines, web pages and ringers\u0026rsquo; personal and society social media, etc. What will be informative to some people, may also be very helpful for miscreants! More advice is available from the National Security Council. Threats from Terrorism # Thankfully terrorist attacks are rare but it is wise for ringers to be alert, not alarmed. Time is well spent considering the safety and security of towers and ringers. Information, guidance and on-line training are available here.\nProfessional Advice, Guidance and Training # Ringers, particularly the Tower Captain and/or Steeple Keeper, are advised to help the tower authority define counter terrorism arrangements for ringers and the tower areas.\nLarger and high profile churches and cathedrals will already have links with a Counter Terrorism Security Advisor (CTSA). CTSAs are based regionally via local police forces. CTSAs provide guidance and advice, rather than direction, that can be considered for each location. They also offer local training sessions.\nAdvice \u0026amp; Guidance # For specific types of venues, including places of worship, can be found here. It provides advice on the types of threat and will assist those writing emergency plans and policies for various scenarios. Further guidance National threat levels are set and updated. Training # Courses are available for free and can also help those writing emergency plans and policies. They should help ringers understand the risks and how they should respond. Records may be maintained of who has been trained with period refresher sessions. (Traditionally, as there is no ringing in Holy Week that may be an opportune time for updating tower records, as well as tidying the belfry!) Ringers may well be familiar with the principles of counter terrorism from training in their workplace, school or college, but they should ensure that they know and understand emergency plans defined for the building where they ring, otherwise there may be less effective outcomes in the event of an emergency.\nEmergency Plans # A simple action list indicating what to do in the event of an incident should be prepared by the tower authority, and ringers should check that a copy is readily available in the ringing room for use in an emergency. The response to an incident will be dependent on the nature of the occurrence and this may well change as the situation unfolds, so clear means of communication are vital.\nTower authorities and ringers must not assume that fire evacuation plans can be implemented during a terrorist incident. Depending on the circumstances, staying inside the building may be safer than going outside. Different procedures are therefore required and the means of alerting people, including ringers, must be distinctly different from fire alarms. Remember that alarms and procedures should consider those with disabilities - not only audible (deafness), not only visual (visually impaired), effective for the less mobile, etc.\nThere should also be plans for heightened security and safety arrangements in the event of either an increase in a specific risk such as lead thefts locally, or higher terrorism threats more widely. These may include people always arriving and leaving in pairs, securing additional doors that would normally be left insecure, etc.\nAs each tower is unique, it is impossible to provide universal rules.\nSecurity measures include those for physical property, personnel, personal and cyber security:\nPhysical Property # The principles for protecting physical assets are to deter, detect, delay, as well as to have plans for action in the event of an incident. Ultimately, there is legislation that organisations should adhere to, including The Health \u0026amp; Safety at Work Act.\nDeter: Reduce the opportunities for adversaries to gain access to people and items that may enable them to carry out an attack\nDetect: Maintain a watch for activity or objects that may be out of the ordinary An attack is likely to be preceded by information gathering and ringers may well be able to spot people, objects or activities that are out of the ordinary. Reporting suspicious behaviour is an important aspect of prevention and policies need to include when behaviour should be reported and to whom, also considering the safety of the individual if they decide to challenge, and balanced by the fact that churches are usually of public interest so not every visitor is suspicious in the first instance.\nThe HOT (Hidden, Obviously suspicious, Typical) protocol is helpful as an aide memoire for people when checking suspicious objects.\nDelay: Have measures in place that will hamper any attack: reinforcement of physical infrastructure; processes for people to follow; allowing time for a response once a threat has been detected. Personnel Security # This includes the processes to ensure that people present have bona fide intentions. As for crime prevention, it is important for church authorities and ringers to know who legitimately accesses the building at any time and their role, but also recognising that churches are public places.\nPersonal Security # Protecting oneself relies on physical security of the tower and also the routes used to and from them.\nOn-line information about individuals and groups is extensive and can be very detailed and informative!\nSecurity guidance for individuals and families.\nGuidance encapsulated in \u0026lsquo;Run, Hide, Tell\u0026rsquo; is specifically for a \u0026lsquo;marauding\u0026rsquo; attack for example in a knife or gun attack.\nCyber Security # Cyber theft and damage is an increasing threat, and risks exist for ringers and their communities.\nInformation on the safe use of devices and on-line safety.\nReturn Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/healthsafety/toweraccess/","title":"Tower Access","section":"Health \u0026 Safety","content":" Tower Access # The following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nIntroduction # No matter how comfortable and well equipped your ringing room or how excellent the go of the bells, if you can\u0026rsquo;t reach them safely they\u0026rsquo;re not much use to you. For that reason it is well worth considering the state of the access route to the tower.\nAll towers are different and each will present a corresponding set of unique circumstances which will affect the decisions made with regard to the access route. The access to the tower is not, of course, the sole province of the ringers but of church-wardens, electricians, bell hangers, masons and sometimes visiting members of the public. As such it is necessary to bear in mind the needs of all users of the tower and to remember that access to the upper reaches of the tower should be as well maintained and as carefully designed as the access to the ringing room.\nTerminology # Figure 1: Terminology used.\nNewel / Newel Post: the central column of a spiral stairway. Rise: the height of a stair from the tread below. Tread: the horizontal surface of a stair upon which users step. Tread Depth: the horizontal distance from the front edge of a tread to the back edge. For spiral stairs an indicative value is measured 300mm (12”) from the outer wall of the stairway. Width: the distance between the outside of the newel post and the outer wall of the stairway. Areas of Risk # The access in the majority of towers is, of course, a spiral staircase although ladders, straight stairways and even lifts/elevators are to be found occasionally. The main areas to consider are these:\nThe condition of the stair treads or rungs. The availability of suitable handholds. Doorways and trap doors. The suitability of the lighting. Other potential hazards. Stair Treads and Ladder Rungs # The condition of the stair treads, is one in which there is usually the most difficulty in making improvements. It is likely that any work in this area will require a faculty and the involvement of the building architect.\nWorn and Uneven Treads # The most common fault to be found with stone stairs is excessive wear in the centre of the tread. When tread wear is becoming significant, more than 6mm depth from the original surface level, the building architect should be consulted and the affected stairs re-surfaced.\nRe-surfacing can be carried out in a variety of ways:\nUsing a modified cementitious mix (a cement and polymer mixture) will allow a thin layer of new material to be applied to existing stair treads with minimal disturbance. Where authenticity of materials is paramount, the existing tread can be cut away to a depth of 25mm (1”) or more and a new stone tread inserted. In some cases the treads can be cut away just enough to form a new, level tread. Wooden treads can be fitted to protect soft stone which is worn or liable to wear. Figure 2: Non-slip steps\nWhere stairs are uneven in their rise they may be made more even by raising the level of low treads (see methods 1 and 2 above) or lowering high ones (method 3).\nSteep Stairways # When a spiral stairway is excessively steep the depth of the treads can be so small that the user is climbing with only their toes on the tread and descending on their heels. In such a situation it is possible to have wooden treads fitted which extend forward from the stone ones. These allow the user to put more of their foot upon each tread while the tread above overhangs. (See figure 2)\nFigure 3: Wooden treads fitted.\nStairs modified in this way should be descended backwards or the advantage is negated.\nSuch extended treads MUST be supported at the front edge by suitable brackets or blocks fixed to the outer wall and newel post.\nDust # Stairs and ladders should be kept clean to avoid dust or dirt making the treads slippery. Having a small vacuum cleaner in the tower specifically for cleaning the stairs is greatly preferable to sweeping.\nLadders # The rungs of ladders should be paid attention for signs of damage or excessive wear. The top and foot fixings should be secure and robust.\nPortable ladders in regular use should be equipped with hooks at the top for secure positioning on a purpose made rail or bracket.\nAny damage to a ladder should be examined, superficial damage to wooden ladders should be smoothed to prevent splinters. If any, more serious damage to wooden or metal ladders is found, replacement of the ladder should be seriously considered.\nWooden ladders are susceptible to insect attack and any sign of woodworm should be investigated, the ladder treated carefully or replaced if there is any doubt as to its structural integrity.\nFigure 4: Ladder with hoops.\nSome modern fixed ladders are fitted with hoops which are designed to reduce the risk of falling but before installing such a hooped ladder the implications should be considered. If the ladder is in the ringing room as access to the room above the hoops may be too close to the rope circle and cause a risk of entanglement or indeed injury to a ringers hands, se image above.\nThe hoops can also make it difficult to carry tools or to move stays or clappers to and from the bell chamber.\nHandholds # Handholds on tower stairways are an important safety feature and need to be carefully designed to be as effective and convenient as possible. There are various implications with each type of handhold.\nExternal Handrail or Hand-Rope on Spiral Stairs # External hand-rails and hand-ropes are common but have a major drawback in most cases. A 30mm diameter handrail mounted 50mm from the wall of the stairwell is the minimum size and finger clearance that should be used but even this most compact design will force the user around 80mm nearer to the centre of the stairwell. This means that the user is walking on the narrower area of each stair and this negates much of the benefit offered by having a handrail.\nA hand-rope suffers from an even worse form of the same problem. If the rope is fixed even as often as six times per turn of the stairway it will reduce the usable width by more than 15% due to the rope ‘cutting the corner’ off the stairway.\nFigure 5: Extreme example of a hand-rope.\nAs a result external hand ropes should not be installed unless fixed very frequently and in a wide staircase.\nWhen spiral stairs have a large radius and a good depth of tread an external handrail can be an ideal arrangement.\nThe height of a hand-rail needed for ascending a spiral stairway is very much lower than the convenient height required for descent. The steeper the stairway is the greater the disparity becomes. The handrail should be at a great enough height to facilitate descent as a low hand rail will force users to bend forward and be less well balanced, increasing their risk of falling.\nInternal Hand-rail or Hand-Rope on Spiral Stairs # Figure 6: Internal hand-rail.\nInternal hand-rails and hand-ropes are also found in many towers and have the advantage of allowing the user to traverse the largest part of the stair tread. An internal handrail may be fixed as little as 3 times per turn of the stairway without disadvantage.\nA hand-rope should not be merely hung from the top of the stairway as a user pulling on the rope near the foot of the stairway will cause a user higher up to have their fingers trapped.\nThe hand-rope should be supported with rings which will hold it clear of the newel and thus remove this disadvantage. It is also advisable to knot or otherwise fix the rope to these rings so that the whole strain of several users climbing with the aid of the rope will not be thrown on a single fixing at the top of the stair-way.\nFigure 7: Series of vertical hand-rails.\nA series of vertical hand-rails on a stair-way has much to recommend it. It is suitable for users of any height, it is sturdy and takes up minimal space. It is also very easy to install.\nMaterials for Handrails or Hand-Ropes # Tough plastic water pipe is often used as a cheap handrail that can be easily fitted. The supporting brackets must of course be close enough together to provide adequate support and stiffness to the handrail. MDPE water pipe may be purchased in coils of 25 or 50 meters length and in various diameters. For handrails 25 or preferably 32 mm diameter should be used.\nFigure 8: Metal handrails\nA more attractive and hardy handrail can be produced by a blacksmith and while the cost will be greater it will also have an almost unlimited life.\nWhere a rope is used it should not be ordinary bell rope but something larger, preferably of 25 or more millimetres in diameter. Rope handrails should be inspected for wear regularly.\nA rope made up of several sallies spliced closely together can be a very attractive and practical handrope.\nFrom an economic point of view it is also worth considering that an external hand-rope uses 50% more rope than an internal one!\nDoorways and Trapdoors # The openings from stairways or ladders into the ringing room or other chambers in the tower is a part of the access route where changes are rarely made. The safety implications of doorway or trapdoor design are worthy of consideration, especially if any building or decorating work is being done in the tower.\nDoorways # In many towers the doorway from the stairway to the ringing room is close behind the back of one of the ringers at their rope. It is obvious that the door opening suddenly could cause an accident so warning signs or a simple latch to secure the door during ringing are sensible measures.\nSome older doors hang on blacksmith made pin hinges. Such doors should be kept closed when ringing is in progress lest a stray rope catch the door and lift it from its hinges.\nDoors which open outwards onto the stairway should not be fitted unless absolutely necessary. A door which must open outwards should open so that the user is leaving onto the upward stairs. If the door opens to the downward side, the open door forces the user to step down two or three stairs at once, risking a fall.\nTrapdoors # Trapdoors in towers are of two types. The first, an almost universal presence, is a trapdoor which is opened only for raising and lowering bells and furniture. Such a trapdoor should be locked and the keys kept by the tower authority as well as by the tower captain if the trapdoor is part of an emergency escape route. The second type is one which is used regularly as the main access to the ringing room or bell chamber.\nBoth types of trapdoor raise the same safety implications but the latter type require more permanent safety measures.\nThe first risk is that of falling down the open hole in the floor and the second is that of the door falling shut and striking a user. This latter could easily cause the user to fall from the ladder or stairs below the trapdoor.\nA permanent barrier around the trapdoor is rarely an option but is the best if it is possible.\nA trapdoor at the side or corner of the room should open away from the wall so that the door itself forms a barrier. A simple gate or bar arranged to hinge from the wall will form a second barrier leaving only the access route open. Such an arrangement also holds the trapdoor open securely and negates both risks at once.\nIf the trapdoor is not adjacent to a wall the provision of a sturdy barrier on three sides of the opening is more difficult but should be arranged.\nTrapdoors should never be left open when not in immediate use and should be counterweighted if possible to minimise the risk of falling shut and striking someone.\nLighting # The lighting of the access route to the tower is a vital factor in ensuring the safety of those using the tower.\nIn spiral stairways the light fittings should be positioned to illuminate the whole stairway. Remember to remind those installing the lighting that the ringers will often be using the route during the hours of darkness and that natural light from windows will be absent.\nThe fittings must be placed so as to pose no danger to those using the stairway. It is not uncommon to find bulky light fittings placed so that those passing them strike their head or shoulder. To minimise the risk of this, light fittings may be fixed to the rear or underside of the stairs above or to the newel post as high up as is possible. This latter is preferable as long as the fittings have a very wide angle of dispersal.\nSafety Lights # Safety lights should be used where possible so that the stairway will remain lit even during a power failure. If the stairs are even and not too steep it may be acceptable to have safety lights only intermittently but any changes or unevenness in the stairs should be covered by the safety lighting. If the stairs are steep, uneven or in any way difficult the whole route should be covered by the safety lighting. Safety lighting should be tested regularly in accordance with the manufacturers instructions.\nWhen a ladder forms part of the access route the top and bottom of the ladder must be covered by safety lighting.\nTypes of Light Fitting. # Various types of lighting are suitable including bulkhead fittings which can have a built in safety light system. Ropes of LEDs have also been used to good effect when fixed along the external wall or newel post, low down so as to illuminate the treads of the stairs. Special arrangements such as an uninterrupted power supply unit would need to be used to maintain the lighting during a power failure.\nA single bulb fitting will give good illumination over a very wide angle but is vulnerable to damage and is liable to dazzle those descending. Incandescent bulbs should never be used due to the danger of burns but LED bulbs or energy saving bulbs which do not get so hot are acceptable.\nIt is also advisable when installing stairway lighting to have a two way switch so that the lights may be turned on at the ringing room doorway should they be turned off at the foot of the stairway by some mischance.\nMore Information on tower lighting can be found at lighting.\nOther Potential Hazards # There are any number of other factors which may affect the safety of those accessing the tower but a few common ones are listed blow with suggestions as to possible remedial actions.\nLow headroom in part or all of the access route:\nWarning signs. Padded edges on trap-door frames or low stairs. Tie rods through stairway:\nRemoval of rod if redundant. Padding. Eye catching paint and good lighting. Little used doorways off access route:\nLock all doors which are not in use. Signs on each door so that visitors do not go off route. Steep stairs or ladders:\nSigns advising users to descend backwards. Unauthorised access to tower:\nSigns to prevent unauthorised access. Barrier across stairway just above ringing room door to prevent visitors going too far up. Yale lock on bottom door, each ringer has a key. Doorbell for visitors.

They are often heavy, they take up space in a ringing room which, in most cases, has little enough space to begin with and many ringers don\u0026rsquo;t like using them anyway. However they are not going away and a well designed and neatly made box will do much to improve the perception of boxes in general.\nA large part of the problem is the provision of boxes which are thrown together without thought, from bits of scrap timber. They are frequently far too small and make the user feel unstable and nervous.\nThere are a few simple criteria for a good ringing box.\nStability: Wobbly boxes are very dangerous. If the floor is uneven, have some wedges or small patches of carpet tile to put under a corner. Be sure that what you use won\u0026rsquo;t work its way out and leave you unstable halfway through a quarter peal.\nStrength: Make sure that the box is well built and sturdy. Even a little bit of flexing can be very off-putting if you\u0026rsquo;re not used to ringing on a box.\nSufficient Size: A box which is too small will make you worry about your feet all the time and put you off your ringing. Boxes should ideally be around 2\u0026rsquo; (600mm) square, enough space to take a small step backwards or sideways if necessary.\nRope Safe: Boxes should not have overhanging lips, corners or anything which could get caught on a moving rope.\nRope Friendly: Smooth rounded edges will not wear ropes unduly. Some people put woollen (NOT synthetic) carpet on the front and top of a box to protect the rope and make it more comfortable but it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of preference, carefully finished woodwork won\u0026rsquo;t hurt the rope or the ringer.\nUser friendly. Boxes should be as light as possible, be easily portable (handle holes with rounded edges are worth the work) and, if possible, stackable to simplify storage and prevent the need for risky stacks of boxes when teaching younger ringers.\nIn the notes that follow, we offer the design for a set of boxes and advice on how to construct them. Other designs are available. It is possible to make a very serviceable box from offcuts and recycled materials. The critical features are making the surface large enough, and the box sufficiently sturdy and stable. A larger rigid box will certainly help the nervous.\nWhatever you decide, will depend on your tower: how many boxes may be required, their height, the flooring, the space available when they are in use as well as when they are NOT in use. The boxes themselves and any wedges, etc. must not themselves become a safety hazard!\nConstruction Notes # For a set of 8 ringing boxes - or fewer if you wish.\nFigure 1: Set of boxes.\nIntroduction # This set of boxes was designed for a 21 cwt ring of ten bells and the large box is suitable for a tenor of this weight or a little larger, with a medium box being suitable for the 9th (c. 14 cwt).\nThese boxes were designed to be strong and sturdy, easy to handle, stackable, safe and aesthetically pleasing. They also have soft edges to reduce rope wear and make them comfortable to lift and carry.\nThe box heights are such that, for example, one large box is the same height as three small ones. This allows two stacks to be placed side by side if required, without creating a step.\nThe dimensions are such that the complete set can be made from two sheets of 8\u0026rsquo; x 4\u0026rsquo; plywood with minimal waste. If you are making your own set you can alter the heights if you wish. There is about 100mm extra height available from the 8\u0026rsquo; x 4\u0026rsquo; sheet after making allowance for cutting wastage. A good use of this might simply be to make three medium height boxes and only four small ones but I chose to have five small boxes as these are the most commonly required.\nPurchase List # 1 sheet 18 mm birch plywood for box tops 1 sheet 12 mm birch plywood for box sides 21 m of 24 mm square ash or poplar angle block c 450 nails of airgun brads (30 mm) PVA glue Wood stain (ir required) Floor varnish, finishing oil or hard waxoil to cover 6 sq m (outside only) or 12 sq m (inside and out)\nCutting list # Quantity Length Width Depth Material Part 32 528 24 24 Poplar, Ash or similar Horizontal angle block 20 68 24 24 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Vertical angle block 8 158 24 24 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; 4 248 24 24 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; 8 580 580 18 Birch plywood Box tops 10 580 90 12 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Box sides (with handle cutout) 4 580 180 12 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; 2 580 270 12 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; 10 606 90 12 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Box front and back 4 606 180 12 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; 2 606 270 12 \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026quot; \u0026ndash; I hope the more expert reader will forgive me for explaining some basics which may seem rather obvious. My intention is, of course, to provide enough information for the less experienced wood worker to complete the work without being left completely at sea. That being said, a certain level of experience and common sense is assumed. The reader is of course responsible for the safe conduct of any work and no responsibility can be accepted by the author or distributor of this information for any accident, damage or injury arising from the use of this information.\nTools # These boxes were designed to be glued and then nailed together with a nail gun . The glue of course provides the structural strength and the nails hold it all together while the glue dries. The ideal list of tools and machines for making these boxes would be as follows:\nPlaner/thicknesser for machining angle block. Vertical panel saw for cutting plywood parts with high precision. Nail gun for 18 gauge 30mm brads. Hand-held router with straight cutter, bearing-guided 1/8\u0026quot; and 1/4\u0026quot; roundover cutters, and bearing-guided trimmer. Router table with straight cutter. Measuring tools and 9\u0026quot; engineer\u0026rsquo;s square. Sand paper, etc. The boxes could of course be constructed with only the following but much more time and patience would be required:\nPanel saw. Tenon saw. No. 4 smoothing plane. No. 7 jointer plane. Block plane. Rebate or badger plane. Hammer. Pin punch. Measuring tools and 9\u0026quot; engineer\u0026rsquo;s square. Sand paper, etc. Construction # Cutting the Parts # Tops # A .pdf format of plans for the tops can be downloaded here.\nIf you are fortunate enough to have access to a vertical panel saw then it will save you a huge amount of time. Some DIY shops will provide a sheet material cutting service but be sure that the results will be truly accurate and square before placing your order as correcting any errors will be slower than cutting the sheets yourself and getting it right first time.\nThe box-tops are the most critical as any errors here may mean that the boxes will not stack properly.\nThe tops must be exactly square, so check every one carefully by measuring diagonals.\nSides # A .pdf format vof plans for the sides can be downloaded here.\nThe (short) sides are almost as crucial as the tops, so check these carefully too. They need to be exactly the same width as the tops and have perfectly square ends.\nNotes 4 mm bevel on exposed edges of all angle blocks. 3 mm round over on all external horizontal edges. 6 mm round over on all external vertical edges. Edge of top is rebated by 2 mm all round. 3 mm round over on all edges of handle openings.\nThe (long) front and back of each box is the least critical and the cutting list shows 2mm extra length on these so that they can be trimmed after assembly. If the ends are perfectly square it will make assembly easier.\nNOTE! When cutting the fronts, backs and sides from the 8\u0026rsquo; strips, you cannot get four fronts out of one strip, you need to cut two sides, a front and a back from each strip.\nAngle block\nThe angle block is listed as 24 mm square but some variation is allowable. If you use larger section you may need to shorten the horizontal blocks to make everything fit.\nTimber\nIf you are buying ready planed timber check it is truly square and that it is good quality wood without sap or significant knots. I have specified poplar or ash for a sturdy construction but good pine would do almost as well if you can procure it. Oak is perhaps best avoided as the acid will rot the brads and that may cause rust marks to show after a while which would be a shame.\nPreparation # I would suggest going through the plywood parts at this stage and choosing the best face of each to go on the outside. I usually pencil \u0026lsquo;IN\u0026rsquo; on the worse side in big letters so I can easily identify the inside when assembling.\nTops # The box-tops need to be rebated around the top edge to provide the clearance for stacking without getting stuck together. The rebate is 10 mm deep and 2 mm wide. The simplest way to achieve this is using a router table, if you have access to one. A hand-held router with the fence fitted will do the job just as well with a little care and patience. If you are using your own vertical panel saw the rebate could even be cut at the same time as the boards are cut to size.\nMark on the inside of each top, the position of the ends of the horizontal angle blocks on all four sides. If you are following the drawings exactly, this will be 26mm from each corner. These marks will show you where to glue the angle blocks during assembly.\nThe edge of the rebate will need to be rounded over with a 1/8\u0026quot; bearing-guided cutter but this will be done after assembly of the boxes.\nSides # Mark on the inside face of each side which edge is to be the top, you will need to be able to see at a glance when gluing up so mark boldly. Handle holes can be made by drilling two 28 mm holes (72 mm apart) and jigsawing between them or by making a jig which screws to the inside of each side piece in turn and guides a router guide collar. If you are drilling for the handle holes, pilot through the board with a 3 mm twist bit, then go halfway through from each side with a 28 mm forstner bit. This will prevent any breakout of the surface and ensure a splinter free handle hole.\nThe handle holes are finished by running a bearing-guided 1/8\u0026quot; roundover cutter around the edges, inside and out (or by many hours of heavy sanding), and finally smooth the holes with fine sand paper.\nAngle Block # Use a router with a bearing-guided bevel cutter to put the 4mm chamfer on one edge of all of your angle blocks. Chamfer the two adjacent edges at both ends of all vertical angle blocks. This will show in the bottom of each box but save you having to think about which way up to put the blocks when gluing up.\nA .pdf format of the plans for the handles can be downloaded here.\nAssembly # The first side # Figure 2: The first side.\nYou will need a good flat work bench and several 10 mm scraps of timber to act as spacers.\nHave your glue, nail gun, nails, square, parts (organised in groups) and a bucket of warm water and a rag ready to hand before you begin.\nIf you are using a nail gun then each entire box can be assembled at once, or you can work in stages if you prefer. If you are not using a nail gun then you will have to proceed in stages. The order of work is the same in both cases.\nClamp or fix a piece of scrap timber to the bench to push the box-top against as you fit the sides.\nPlace the box-top upside down on your work bench with a 10 mm spacer at each end of the side you are working on.\nTake your first horizontal angle block. The sides which are not adjacent to the bevel are to be glued so apply a generous bead of glue to one of these and then place the block on the box-top between the marks you prepared earlier. The bevel must be towards to middle of the box.\nPress hard and rub the block around a little to spread the glue and give a firm joint. Work the block into place between your marks and with the outer face perfectly flush with the edge of the top at both ends.\nNail one end down with one nail then check the other end and nail it down too. If the block is not perfectly straight, bend the middle into place and add nails as necessary to keep it perfectly flush with the edge. Five or six nails should be sufficient. Press down hard when firing the nail gun to keep the glue joint tight. Now pick up your first side piece and apply two beads of glue, one right by the top edge and another (more generous) about 20 mm down from the edge. Place the top edge of the side piece on the spacers (to give the 10 mm rebate for stacking) and press it against the box-top edge and the angle block you just fitted. Rub it about a little as with the angle block to spread the glue and make a good joint and then align the ends of the side with the ends of the box-top. If you were accurate in the cutting both ends will align perfectly. If there is more than about 0.5 mm excess, align one end and we\u0026rsquo;ll come back to the other later.\nDrive one nail (from the outside) and check the alignment. If necessary, adjust with a ‘persuader’ while protecting the edge of the work with a bit of scrap timber. Drive the rest of the nails, pushing hard as you do so.\nThe front # Now fit the next horizontal angle block as before and then fit the front as you did with the side, remembering to add a bead of glue down the end where it meets the side piece. Align the end of the front to the face of the side, the excess will all be at the other end and can be trimmed off after assembly is complete.\nTake the first vertical angle block and apply glue to both gluing faces (those not adjacent to the chamfer) and to the top end. Insert the vertical angle block into the corner between the two horizontal blocks and rub it in. Drive a couple of nails through the side piece into the vertical block. The side will ensure that the front is truly square to the top (assuming your cutting was accurate) but you need to check that the side is, itself, vertical. If you are confident that the ends of the front and back are all truly square you can align the side to that and fix with nails but it\u0026rsquo;s best to use a tri-square and be certain.\nYou should now have one corner assembled with all angles square and a 10 mm x 14 mm rebate around two sides of your box-top. Now use the rag and warm water to clean away any excess glue from the outside of the box. Wring the rag out fairly well to avoid soaking your work but do rub away all traces of glue as it will show under the varnish if left. You can clean up the inside of the box if you wish but since the glue dries clear it will barely show there if you leave it.\nThe rest # You can now leave the box to dry if you wish but ensure that the unsecured ends of the front and side are square to the top now, as you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to bend them much once dry.\nA picture frame clamp would be perfect to hold them square should they need support but any other method will do.\nIf you found that the side piece was too long, this is the moment to trim it off with a block plane.\nNext attach the second side and then the back as described.\nCheck each corner as you assemble it to ensure that everything is truly square and correctly aligned.\nOnce you have completed assembling one box there is a strong temptation to try it for size. Do wait for the glue to be fully dry and remember that you will have to sand off any footprints afterwards!\nFigure 3: Nearly complete.\nFinishing # Having assembled the boxes you will see that the front and back are a little longer than required and these ends can now be trimmed off using a block plane or a router with a bearing-guided trimmer. Any small variations or misalignments in the top and bottom edges of the fronts, backs and sides can also be corrected with a plane (you may need a rebate or bager plane for the top edges).\nThe round-over on all external edges can now be cut. Use the 1/4\u0026quot; cutter first to round-over the vertical edges. Then change to the 1/8\u0026quot; cutter and round-over all of the horizontals. For rounding-over the top edge of the box-top run the base of the router on the box side and for the sides run the router base on the box-top. For the bottom inside edges do as much as possible from the inside of the box and do the corners with the router on the edge of the sides. Finish all edges with sandpaper to smooth out any bumps, remove any burn marks and round-over any bits that the router couldn\u0026rsquo;t reach.\nYou should now have a finished box with every edge smooth, clean and comfortable to touch. Sand all surfaces smooth, apply whatever stain you require and then finish with a floor varnish, hard wax oil or finishing oil. It is a good idea to test the finish first to ensure that is will not be too smooth or slippery to safely ring on.\nNotes\nIn use, I have found that these boxes are easier to keep standing on edge as it allows you to choose a larger box without having to move all of the small ones off the top first, but beware of the risk of the boxes falling over.\nOn some floorings the boxes can slide about when raising larger bells. Where the boxes are semipermanent you can prevent them sliding by fitting a floor plate. For these boxes the floor plate is 576 mm square and made of 12 mm ply and finished to match the boxes. The upper edges are rounded over using the 1/8\u0026quot; cutter and the plate is screwed to the floor in the desired position. Since the box will normally sit over the plate it does not present a trip hazard but if a very tall ringer wants to ring without the box, it can be removed and the plate is exactly equivalent to the top of the boxes.\nI hope that these notes and the drawings that they accompany will be of use to people.

This old gas lamp would be better conserved properly for its engineering heritage value\nIntroduction # Lighting in and around a tower is often taken for granted until it is not working!\nAs a consequence of significant technical developments in lighting in the last few years, most people now benefit from good quality artificial light in their domestic, leisure and professional environments.\nBuildings containing rings of bells too are exploiting new fixtures and fittings to reduce power consumption. While making the lighting more efficient, appropriately designed modern units should also enhance the effectiveness of the lighting.\nTowers, however, are not always included in improvement schemes and, in some cases, installations have not recognised the specific needs of ringers for ringing. Traditional tungsten filament bulbs have been phased out so this note aims to offer some basic advice for steeple keepers and ringers. A few specific considerations and options will be presented as a guide. As is typical in ringing, every tower and part of a tower has to be considered on a case by case basis as the situations are so varied.\nCaution – It is essential that specialist advice and qualified contractors are used in any major work on electrical lighting. The tower authority should also be involved; in a church setting, a faculty may be required for more significant modifications to lighting as part of the electrical installations. In this short note, suggestions are offered for lighting in (and around) the tower that are suitable for routine ringing. Additional comments are added as guidance for work such as maintenance in and around the tower.\nFigure 2: Tangles of wires with suspended bulbs are not a safe arrangement!\nThe Ringing Room # There are several factors that need to be considered in a ringing room. If the same space is not used only by ringers, then it may even be necessary to have separate switched systems for the different users.\nThe Basic Fittings # There is now a huge range of very stylish light fittings available and they are being developed rapidly.\nModern fittings can be very compact and it should be possible to find a style that is suitable for most locations. In towers, professional quality lighting is more appropriate than domestic, as it should be. Professional quality should offer more rugged and durable while still aesthetically attractive.\nProfessional quality fittings are also designed specifically to offer good quality uniform light, with standard replaceable lamps. Whatever is chosen should also be compatible with the historic fabric in which it is being installed.\nLight fixtures must not hinder rope movement either during normal ringing, on breaking or potentially when ropes lash about during teaching. Professional designs tend to not have protruding arms or other features that could be hazardous.\nModern LEDs (light emitting diodes) do not get hot and luminaires fitted with LEDs should be used in any new installation or upgrade. LEDs have largely eliminated the traditional risk of lamps becoming hot and hence a fire risk, especially when left on for 3 or more hours.\nIntensity and Glare # Lighting intensity needs to be similar to daylight or that created in a normal domestic or offic environment, and preferably uniform across the space, without strong reflections that may dazzle ringers. It is difficult to specify as the apparent illumination will depend on several factors. The light intensity perceived by the human eye depends on wavelength of the source and the illumination will depend markedly on the size of the space, surface finish, colour and reflectivity of wall coverings, furniture, windows, etc..\nPosition # More critical than lighting intensity, is the position and direction of the lights. Since all ringers will be looking across and around a ringing room during ringing, the fittings must all be well above normal sight lines to avoid dazzle and discomfort. (The sun causes similar problems in some towers with windows; adjustable curtains or blinds are essential at some times of the day and year. In rare instances, even external floodlights have been known to aggravate the ringers!)\nHow lamps are to be replaced must be planned prior to finalising the selection of the installation.\nLighting should be installed, if at all possible, so that scaffolding or ladders will not be required for lamp replacement.\nFigure 3: Typical strip light diffuser with some debris building up\nShading # The light must be diffuse; depending on the source, diffusers may be required to minimise glare. Many modern sources are much more intense and directional than traditional bulbs so care is required when installing new fittings at the same location as a previous lamp. The style of shade also requires careful selection. If dust, insects, spiders or other debris can easily collect in a shade or diffuser, this will soon reduce the light efficiency, even if not posing a fire hazard as would have occurred with traditional tungsten filament bulbs. Ringers should not be expected to clean out lamp shades at frequent intervals.\nFigure 4: Up and Down combined fitting\nThis picture shows an installation in the body of a building - a dual fitting with uplighter and down-lighter and, adjacent to this, a spot light. This arrangement enables different lighting effects for different functions in the building. However, this would not be suitable in a ringing room. The challenge here is that scaffolding is required for every lamp change, and debris is building up in some of the globes. No doubt, dust will also be settling on the uplighters and hence reducing their efficacy.\nFigure 5: Uplighter\nThis picture shows an uplighter giving a good light out of the way of ropes and ringers. Inevitably, it may still collect debris.\nFlicker # A strongly visible flickering (i.e. a few per second, as for example, in a strip light) probably indicates a fault. A more rapid flicking (several tens per second) may be a consequence of the operation of the electrical system and may cause a stroboscopic effect associated with the movement of striped sallies.\nSome people are more sensitive to this than others so it is difficult to set a specification. Specialist advice may be required and specifications for contractors should mention the movement of striped “sallies” on the ropes used in bell ringing.\nSwitches # Their position and function need careful thought. One switch, for example at the bottom of the tower, may simply operate all the lights thus avoiding some lights being left on, as can arise with several switches. However, this simplicity can also mean that ringers could be plunged into darkness inadvertently.\nTwo way switches on the stairs (I.e. the same function achieved at both the top and bottom), plus a separate switch for the ringing room is probably the optimum for many situations (as conventional in a 2 storey house).\nThe Bell Chamber # Lighting in the bell chamber is also covered in Lighting and electrical equipment in \u0026lsquo;Belfry Upkeep\u0026rsquo;.\nOften a very neglected ‘black hole’, bell chambers do need excellent lighting as they typically have little natural light even during daylight hours.\nA good quality room light is a basic requirement, but it will not be possible to position a single lamp to enable people undertaking maintenance activities to see their way over, under and around the bells and frame. Several lights should be installed - the light fixtures and fittings should be robust, remembering that work in the bell chamber is likely to involve use of bulky tools and shifting of awkward, large and very heavy items. Water and insect/vermin protection should also be considered; mice and squirrels have a propensity to chew cables! While it is best to keep vermin out of towers, when there is a known problem cables should be installed in metal conduit or trunking, or metal clad cables used.\nLighting circuits are not adequate for modern power tools deployed for maintenance work; separate power circuits are therefore essential for heavy duty power tools and lifting gear, and to provide supplementary lighting from additional movable lamp stands and hand-lamps repositioned when required.\nPeople working in a bell chamber, may well now use supplementary battery operated lamps, as these provide excellent illumination where required, for extended periods of time and in compact format.\nHead torches are particularly useful.\nStairs # Even if there are some windows on the staircase, good lighting is essential on staircases. Compact and flexible systems are now available, such as LED light ropes, that provide excellent lighting in comparison with traditional lamps. As advised repeatedly, care should be taken to purchase and install good quality products. Fixing requires careful planning to provide the light, without risk of damage or breakage and without impeding people or equipment/tools and other things being carried up and down what is often a tight space. In particular, many staircases are tight for space and installers should ensure that lamps are not positioned so that they could be knocked or even used as hand holds!\nIntermediate Rooms # Lighting in such spaces will depend on usage. The major consideration for ringers is that the light fittings must not impede the rope travel either during normal ringing nor during any accidental atypical rope movement as could occur if a rope breaks.\nExternal Approaches, Car Parks, etc. # Lighting for these areas should be included as an integral part of the installations in and around the building. Entrances to towers, however, may be very different from the main routes used by the majority of users so may require separate ighting from the principal routes. They are often overlooked!\nEmergency Lighting # Lighting Failure # Failure may be due to accidental operation of a switch, power failure or lamp failure. These 3 causes need to be addressed separately. Lamp positions should take into account the risks of any one lamp failing; i.e. any space must not be totally dependent on a single bulb. Switch positions can minimise the power being turned off accidentally, but power failure requires a separate emergency power supply that would last for an appropriate length of time, normally 1 or 3 hours.\nEmergency Systems # Figure 6: Tower with lamps, uplighters and emergency lighting (indicated).\nThis should be integrated with the building system in case of power cuts. Ideally, the lighting is integrated with the emergency exit signage. The light source is usually a low power consumption lamp run from rechargeable batteries. Integrated emergency lighting is normally installed with fire/heat-proof cable (technically MICC/MICV or FP200 / FP400). If not integrated with the building system, then a separate system may be purchased and installed relatively economically and safely. While most people using the building may expect to leave in the event of an extended power failure, ringers may (if safe otherwise to do so) wish to continue ringing for up to 45 minutes or even the greater part of 3 hours! Whatever approach is adopted, the system must be tested periodically and test records retained.\nA good quality, rechargeable torch is an asset in any tower, as long as it is kept fully charged and could be retrieved (even by visitors who may not know the tower) in total darkness.\nNote that there is a relevant British Standard - Emergency lighting. Code of practice for the emergency escape lighting of premises BS 5266-1 – the current version (issued May 2016) is available from the Health and Safety Executive website but cost £264 in December 2019.\nFigure Details Source 1 Old gas fitting Photo: CCCBR 2 Tangle of fittings Photo: CCCBR 3 Diffused strip light Photo: CCCBR 4 Combination uplighter and downlighter Photo: CCCBR 5 Uplighter Photo: CCCBR 6 Lamps, uplighters and emergency lighting Photo: CCCBR Return Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/ringingroom/handbells/","title":"Handbells","section":"Ringing Room","content":" Handbells # A brief guide\nThe following, written by Alison Hodge, was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.\nFigure 1: Part of a set of hand bells\nIntroduction # In the months whilst ringing was restricted due to the COVID pandemic, the interest in ringing handbells increased, including outside during warmer weather. This note aims to summarise some points that people may wish to consider.\nMusical handbells are usually in tuned sets, unlike small school bells, etc. The metal is bronze about 80% copper and 20% tin (tower bells are about 77% copper and 23% tin). The handle is usually thick leather, although bells manufactured in America often have plastic handles. The clapper has a rigid shaft so that the bell can be struck in a controlled way.\nTunes or Changes # Handbells can be used to ring musical tunes or for change ringing. What a group chooses to ring will partly determine how many bells will be needed and what sizes. Change ringing will usually be rung using 6, 8, 10 or 12 handbells (but may be more) with bells in a musical scale. While tunes may be rung on 8 or perhaps 12 bells, the music will be enhanced by the availability of more bells, including some sharps or flats, or a fully chromatic set.\nIn the USA ‘handbell ringing’ is usually taken to mean tune ringing with large groups of people forming ‘bell choirs’ often in schools, colleges, churches or community groups.\nThere are similar groups or teams in the UK, but few as large as in the USA.\nHandbell Musicians of America Handbell Ringers of Great Britain making music) In the UK, handbell ringing is more often associated with change ringing, but not by all.\nExamples of change ringing -\nPevensey Delight Minor Highly commended example. Plain Bob Triples Acquiring Handbells # Many towers and ringing societies own handbells so sets may be available to borrow.\nIf buying, this will be a personal (or committee) decision depending on funds available, intended use and experience. Are you complete beginners? Or do you have some experience with handbells and now wish to get your own set?\nNew Sets # New sets of handbells are available from various suppliers both in the UK and USA. It is also worth considering ‘Bell plates’ and ‘hand chimes’ for schools and groups of younger people. These create similar effects, are more often used for tune ringing, are cheaper and more rugged.\nThe number and tone will depend on what you want to ring and as much as anything will be a personal (or committee) choice, and finally, of course, the cost!\nNew sets will provide you with known quality – manufacturers include:\nTaylor’s of Loughborough Bells of Whitechapel Malmark (USA) also suppliers of hand chimes and other accessories Schulmerich (USA) also supplier of hand chimes and extensive range of accessories Belleplates Second Hand # Second hand sets may be advertised e.g. in The Ringing World or on websites such as Handbell Ringers of Great Britain.\nAuction houses sometimes have sets or small numbers of bells for sale. It will be helpful if you have some knowledge of what to look for if buying at auction. Prices can range from a bargain to excessive!\nSets, part sets and odd bells may be found occasionally in second hand shops, car boot sales, etc. As with auctions, knowledge of what to consider will help.\nFigure 2: Set of small tuned \u0026lsquo;rainbow\u0026rsquo; bells\nSmall musical handbells intended for children are also now sold in rainbow colours. Sets including different notes are available (including sharps/flats). Although each bell measures almost the same size as others within a set, they are tuned to different notes. These are comparatively cheap but the clappers are attached by springs so do not have the same action as traditional handbells. They are available from various sources, such as [Thomann](https://thomann.de/gb/thomann_rainbow_handbells_trhb_20.htm?glp=1\u0026gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-8HwypDk7AIVVvtCh3D4QHCEAQYBCABEgLai_ D_BwE) on the internet as toys and education aids.\nRanges # For change ringing a set of 12 bells perhaps size 12 F to 1 C, diatonic (i.e. just the white notes of a piano). Such a set would offer 12 bells for changes, an 8, and light 6 or a heavier 6. If you added a 13th bell this could be a little top D that enables a heavy 6 and a light 6 simultaneously.\nThis size range is not too heavy, but some people find the little bells too light and quiet. Alternatively, with heavier bells, you could get a set starting at 15 C up to 4 G, with a 13th being 3 A. 12 bells would also enable you to ring basic tunes, if you chose to do so.\nFor tune ringing, a fully chromatic set will offer more flexibility. Larger groups may include several bells of the same note in the higher pitch range, to reinforce the intensity of the sound.\nTone # The tone of a handbell will depend on various factors particularly the founder, age and profile of the bells. Small bells will be quieter so achieving a balance within a set with larger bells needs care. The finish of the clapper surface may be altered to adjust this – hard or soft leather, felt or nylon.\nBells from some founders will resonate (i.e. hum) for longer. This may be preferable for tune ringing but for change ringing a more mellow tone with less hum is often preferred so that the rhythmic strike of each bell in the change is audible.\nThe room acoustic will also affect the audibility of the bells – for change ringing a room with soft furnishing to dampen the sound will be preferable.\nFigure 3: A typical handbell clapper (leather pads removed from the ball and leather felts from the springs)\nTips when buying second hand bells\nWhy they are being sold? What is their condition? What does the vendor’s description say? e.g. what does ‘excellent condition’ mean? What founder? All the same founder? Known founder may enable bells to be replaced/added. Are any bells cracked or chipped? NB cracks may not be visible. Are the leather handles sound, clean and dry, and not too heavily cracked or kinked, especially at the rivets? Are the clappers and springs in place, with the 2 felt pads on each spring? Do the clapper balls have the leather or nylon pads that strike the bell in place? Are the castings clean, unmarked, without verdigris, apart perhaps from a few light finger prints? Is there any sign of heavy, repeated polishing? How have they been stored and used? Are rigid boxes or cases included in the sale? What are the cost and transport arrangements? **[Bill Butler’s book \u0026lsquo;Musical Handbells\u0026rsquo; is available from various sources, such as abebooks, and provides excellent background about handbells generally, including a lot of history.\nFigure 4: Handbell during restoration showing the makers mark - the initials of Henry Symondson which may help in dating a bell\nMaintenance, Repairs \u0026amp; Restoration # Manufacturers provide this service as well as other small companies and individuals. Be cautious if asking a saddler to replace a leather handle.\nLeather handles, clapper pads, felts, etc. are relatively readily replaced. Clappers may be replaceable, but possibly not with the same design as originals in older sets by some founders.\nStorage # Figure 5: Handbells stored in a custom-made carrying case\nHandbells are expensive musical instruments and as such, should ideally be stored in custom designed rigid instrument cases or wooden boxes. Each bell should be held separately from its neighbours. Strong latches ideally lockable, that will not burst open are important. The practical point to consider is the total weight and size of each case – are they to be carried by hand or would a large, heavy case require a trolley?\nBells should be kept clean and dry, at normal room temperature with some air circulation, away from anything that may corrode the metal of the bells or accelerate degradation of leather handles. It is best that the bells do not touch each other, even avoid the leather of one touching the metal of another. Note that storage boxes may be a requirement in some insurance policies.\nThin cardboard boxes, carrier bags and other lightweight containers are not recommended. Modern rigid plastic storage boxes, especially those with tight-fitting lids, may appear to be suitable but the contents may ‘sweat’ if stored where the temperature fluctuates; condensation may build up, causing tarnishing of the metal and mould and degradation of the leather.\nGlass-fronted cases or an open rack in a tower or church were often the traditional storage for a church owned set of hand bells. While these may appear to be appropriate and rather attractive, perhaps donated or a memorial, they have drawbacks. Sadly, the risk of theft or misuse, even if the case is locked, is probably too great.\nNew bells may be supplied in cases and specialist suppliers will make them to order.\nStrong flight cases and instrument cases are available from various supplies, relatively cheaply, leaving the design and fabrication of supporting inserts for the bells as a challenge for ingenuity and skill!\nRinging Handbells # Figure 6: Handbell held firmly close to the leather cap\nRinging handbells is typically a group activity: it is best to join a group to be taught how to ring handbells. They are fragile and expensive musical instruments.\nThe metal is brittle and will crack if dropped or knocked against a hard surface or even another bell! They should be held firmly or the leather straps will wear quickly where riveted to the bell; the likelihood of bells together is greater if they are not held firmly, and could cause damage to the bell casting.\nIt is also best not to touch the metal with bare hands as grease on hands can tarnish the metal, very noticeable especially on highly polished bells. Some handbell owners require that ringers wear gloves when handling their bells. Polishing is to be avoided, and if required, only the finest grade metal polish should be used very infrequently, otherwise the metal will be worn very gradually. This is especially important for any bells that may be engraved.\nFigure 7: Engraved handbell\nThe springs (that enable the clapper to bounce off the bell surface) may need to be ‘set’. This is best done by someone with experience. For change ringing, the clappers need to sound equally at both hand stroke and back stroke. For tune ringing in which only one motion is used to sound the bell, the clappers may be set so that the clapper does not usually strike on one side of the bell, but does on the other side. This is a reason why some sets of bells are designated for either change ringing or tune ringing but not both.\nFor tune ringing, there are various styles, with the most frequently encountered summarised here\nChange ringing on handbells normally involves each ringer ringing one bell in each hand, but occasionally 2 in each hand. Demonstrations of handbell ringing may also include ‘lapping’\nInsurance # Ringing societies and churches may well include their sets of handbells as specific items in their insurance policy. Privately owned sets of handbells may or may not be covered in a domestic household policy. It is prudent to check the policy terms in detail, where and how the bells will be stored, are they covered if left in a vehicle, or if taken overseas, are there restrictions on who may use them, e.g. members only, over 18 years?\nSpecialist musical instrument insurers may insure handbells – commercial providers include -\nNew Moon Allianz More Information # Tune ringing – Handbell ringers of Great Britain\nVarious books on change ringing:\nChange ringing on handbells by C W Woolley, available from the CCCBR shop) Beginners Guild to Change Ringing on handbells by Bill Butler, available from the CCCBR shop Musical handbells by Bill Butler, covers mainly the history of handbells and their founders but is also very useful aid to identifying the founder of handbells.

The person appointed may not be called the ‘Tower Captain’ in all towers – ‘Ringing Master’ is another title that is often used, or that may be used for another person with different responsibilities. In this note, the words ‘Tower Captain’ will be used even if local terminology is different from this.\nThese notes have been written from the perspective of churches in the Church of England. Some ringing societies offer advice for towers in their area, with specific advice on appointments and responsibilities. Although probably broadly applicable, local differences should be considered for towers that are not in the Church of England, or not in church ownership.\nMaking the Appointment # Normally, the Tower Captain is appointed by the incumbent of the church concerned. This is a responsible position in a church with bells and should be in writing, ideally for a defined period of time. The incumbent will usually consult the ringers as to who is appointed. This may be from a recommendation made at a tower AGM with the incumbent present, but arrangements vary from church to church.\nThe Role and Responsibilities of Tower Captain # Normally the Tower Captain is a bell ringer. They will be delegated specific responsibilities on appointment that are likely to include the following:\nMaintain regular two-way contact both formally and informally about the bells and ringing, with the incumbent, PCC, church wardens and administrator. Assist with carrying out and implementing church risk assessments, and ensure that ringing and ringers are addressed appropriately in the church health and safety policies. Ensure that the bells and associated infrastructure are in good condition and that appropriate maintenance inspections and repairs are carried out. Ensure that activities in the tower are carried out safely. Arrange for the bells to be rung for services and on other appropriate occasions. Lead the band of ringers, including recruitment, training and development of a good standard of ringing skills. Comply with any requirements set out in the parish insurance policy. Ensure that activities in the tower are carried out in accordance with the relevant Safeguarding Policy. Ensure that ringers’ personal data (e.g. phone numbers, emails, addresses) are managed in accordance with the requirements of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) legislation. Make appropriate arrangements for the secure management of tower assets (e.g. handbells, tower records) and money raised for the tower and bells, including wedding fees and visitor donations. Be a member of, or co-opted to, the PCC. Be the point of contact with the local ringing society. Promote bell ringing positively within the church and local community. Undergo a personal DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check as required for groups such as bell ringers (this cannot be delegated). In most towers, some of these responsibilities may be delegated to other ringers, probably as agreed at an AGM of the Ringers. These may include Ringing Master, Tower Secretary, Steeple Keeper and Ringing Teachers. It is also practical for a Deputy Tower Captain to be appointed, to provide cover for absence and opportunities for others to gain experience and offer succession.\nReturn Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":25,"href":"/docs/buildingateam/planning/","title":"Planning ringing","section":"The Ringers","content":" Planning ringing # These are only suggestions of ways of arranging ringing. Timing # REMEMBER\nNot all ringers will arrive on time. Allow for greeting, hanging up coats, etc. Bells may have to be raised and lowered which may take up to 15 minutes and reduce the time to achieve aims. Aim to give everyone at least one piece of useful and satisfying ringing. Approximate timings of touches (used here to mean any piece of ringing): 120 changes of Doubles or Minor takes 4-5 minutes. 4-5 minutes is a suitable time for rounds and call changes. On 8, or more, pieces will generally be longer. Allow 2-3 minutes to change over between pieces. Plan Ahead # To get the most out of the time available plan at least one touch ahead. This should reduce gaps between touches and allow more ringing time.\nKnow what is going to be rung next and for whose primary benefit. Ringers benefit from knowing what is coming next, they can mentally rehearse or even look up things while sitting out. If sessions are regularly run to a pattern, ringers start to follow the pattern and know when they are likely to get a chance to ring what they need to practice. Try to avoid the trap where the ‘good’ ringer(s) only come at the end of the practice for the ‘good/advanced ringing’. Assess what the least and most advanced levels of ringing that there is value in performing. If a practice session, there is little point practicing what all the ringers present have already mastered. There is no point in trying to ring something for which there are not got enough competent ringers to support those who are learning. Triage the ringers by ability. Ringers\u0026rsquo; abilities and experience vary. Roughly assign the ringers to at least, a learner, middling and higher ability group. Be prepared to adjust this as the session proceeds, we all have good days and bad days. Try to arrange the ringing so that everyone gets something out of the session. Sequence the touches to provide opportunities for the ringers, from the three groups, in turn. Aim to start with the simplest ringing needed for the least able group and end with the most advanced that the higher ability group should be able to ring well. The aim is to end on a high point, one that hopefully allows the less able to hear what better ringing sounds like. For a ninety-minute practice session, you should now have a basic template of 11 touches.\nRing up, in peal if you can (and the bells are down). Simple touch for some members of least able group. Relatively simple touch for middle ability group. Relatively simple touch for higher ability group. Least able group touch. Middle ability group touch. Challenging higher ability group touch (remember you are aiming for a well struck higher ability group piece to end with). Least able group touch. Middle ability group touch. Low risk higher ability group touch. Ring down, in peal if you can (and the bells are to be lowered). Note: This is a suggested template not a rigid plan.\nBe aware of:\nThe need to adjust your template as the session proceeds. There may be insufficient ringers to divide into three or even two ability groups. There may not be a low-risk option for that final well struck touch. It might be an opportunity to practice ringing up and down in peal more than once! What matters is to know what is going to be rung next and, to some extent, who is going to ring it. This may cut out dithering between touches and gives the ringers confidence that the session is running proactively.\nPlace the band # At first this can seem overly officious and may need an explaination.\nThe primary purpose of placing a band during a session, as opposed to a quarter peal or peal, is to make sure that ringers practice something with the best possible chance of success.\nIf there is more than one less able ringer in the band try to avoid placing them on adjacent (coursing) bells. Hopefully it also means that the rest of the band is sufficiently competent to give the improvers the support they need. For the best chance of success and better striking, the generally accepted method is to place the band from the extremes inwards starting with the tenor and then for odd-bell methods on even numbers of bells the heaviest working bell i.e., for Doubles in a six-bell tower the 5th. Next comes the treble as the treble provides the framework around which the method is constructed (obviously not true for a principal e.g. Stedman). If an inside bell goes wrong the rest of the ringers can normally cope and there is a fair chance of putting things right. If the treble goes wrong, it affects all the other ringers. Also note that because the difference in swing speeds is most pronounced between tenor and treble, striking these bells well requires more reliance of listening and rhythm than the middle bells do. Good ringers will not object to ringing the treble, indeed they will often rightly regard being asked to as a complement.\nDuring a session, a ringer may need to practice plain hunting to a method. That places that ringer on the treble. Ideally the rest of the band needs to be able to ring with an unreliable treble. Combining an inexperienced treble ringer with an inexperienced inside ringer rarely ends well.\nIt is a good idea to give a ringer experience on different bells which may not be ideal for success and striking. Placing a band during a session often is a compromise between the best ringing and advancement of individuals.\nPlacing bands may:\nCut out delays caused by ringers hanging back when ringers are asked to ‘catch-hold for …’. Pre-empt the need to remove a ringer who thinks they can ring it. Overcome the hesitancy of better ringers to not ring too often and appear greedy. This may allow an extra touch or two. Announcing the next two touches, together with the bells the ‘target’ ringers are to ring, may speed things up. (Note, for some bands speeding things up may be a bad idea, they may be there as much for social as ringing reasons. Assuming the aim is to improve the ringing, use a gentle nudge in that direction rather than go full throttle into fast paced sessions.)\nNominate a conductor # Nominate a competent conductor if a touch is for the benefit of less able ringers. If the purpose is to give a ringer conducting practice, then give them a competent band. Less able ringers’ confidence will be damaged if something is miscalled and they may blame themselves. The learner conductor’s confidence will be damaged if they cannot know where to put calls because bells, particularly the treble, are in the wrong place.\nSummary # Some, maybe all, of the tips above may seem totally unrealistic in your tower.\nUse your skills to assess both the attitude and ability of your ringers. This will determine how the session can be structured and how hard the push can be. Remember, unless there is very good sound control or simulators on all bells, any session is a very public affair. The quality of the ringing says something about the church you ring at. Try to encourage the pursuit of good ringing in all ringers remembering that good ringing does not need to be advanced ringing. Applying aspects of the advice above should help.\nImage Credits # Figure Details Source Title Ringers at Southrepps, Norfolk Picture: James Kirkcaldy Return Disclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 1.1, March 2023\n© 2023 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/docs/buildingateam/outing/","title":"Organising an Outing","section":"The Ringers","content":" Organising an Outing # Figure 1: Appledore, Kent\nA ringing outing can be an enjoyable and useful way of introducing ringers to a wider variety of bells than they might otherwise encounter.\nIt can help those involved to improve bell control and ringing skills, as it is like having multiple practices in one day.\nMost importantly, it is a very good way of getting the ringers together socially.\nAlmost all towers are available, as long as the right people are contacted. There may be spectacular buildings and impressive rings of bells which will give lasting memories of the outing. There can be a wide range of access routes, ringing rooms and decoration.\nOutings are usually one day affairs, but they may last a weekend or longer. Similar arrangements are necessary for all.\nAnyone can organise an outing if they follow a few simple rules. Take care not to leave anything to chance, and make sure the arrangements are made in good time.\nPlanning # Date # It is important to fix the date as early as possible and to ensure that the participants put this in their diaries and calendars.\nIdeally start making the arrangements two to three months in advance. Remember, the responses received may require a rearrangement of the timetable.\nParticipants # Consider who will support the outing and who will benefit from the outing.\nIf a tower outing, always invite any regular visitors. An ideal minimum is twelve people whilst around twenty people is about right.\nConsider whether to invite non-ringers, such as friends and relations of the ringers; this may influence the choice of route, the mode of transport and the places to visit.\nThe towers chosen should be influenced by the experience of the ringers. Ringing on bells which are too difficult for the majority may spoil the day. If there ringers are mainly inexperienced, invite some more experienced ringers along to help. Perhaps ask the participants for ideas of towers to be visited with the proviso that not all requests can be met.\nFigure 2: Fairfield, Kent\nDestination # It is not a good idea to travel half way across the country in a day. This will definitely take the edge off of the most successful outing.\nTowers # This will depend on the travel distance, the number of towers and the proposed time at each tower. As a rule five towers a day is about right, with a lunch break after two (or three) of these. More towers in a day is feasible, however this will shorten the time spent at each.\nREMEMBER Too many towers in a day can lead to fatigue and, just like a long return journey home, can take the edge off a successful outing.\nTimings # Take into consideration any proposed breaks including at the end of the day.\nIf there are 20 ringers on the outing aim for at least an hour per tower.\nMost places are very welcoming and permit ringing at the times requested, especially if it is about an hour\u0026rsquo;s ringing. N.B. An especially large party may neccesitate a longer time. Consider shorter times when there are fewer bells, people may get fed up with an hour at an unrewarding six; conversely an hour at a decent ten may not be enough.\nPlan around the following:\nIf travelling by car, mini-bus or coach a reasonable average speed is 30 mph or less; if cycling allow an average of 6 for mph; if walking allow an average of 2 mph. On-line route planners can be of use but be aware that these tend to under estimate the time required. If travelling by mini-bus or coach be aware that these may be too large to negotiate some country lanes. Time to park the transport and get from the transport to the tower and the same to return (around 15 minutes). This is probably when walking or cycling. Time to raise the bells and the same to lower the bells (5-10 minutes). Time to allow every ringer a reasonable ring. Time for comfort and refreshment breaks. Possible restrictions in the time of day that towers are available; town centre towers may restrict ringing to after shop opening times, towers near schools may only permit ringing outside of school hours. A major event in an area e.g. a festival may cause disruption. Some flexibility as it may be necessary to reschedule part of the tour dependent on replies. Figure 3: Brookland, Kent\nTower Contacts # Historically, contacts were obtained using paper copies of the local ringing society report or Crockford\u0026rsquo;s Clerical Directory (may be available in a library reference section). Crockford\u0026rsquo;s is produced annually and is available on-line to subscribers. It may still be necessary to use either.\nThese days, the majority of terrritorial ringing societies publish a means of contact on-line; this may be anonymised e.g. @.\nInitially, contact the listed tower contact; be aware that they may not be a ringer. If there is no identified contact, try the local ringing society (or branch) secretary who should be able to advise or may possibly make contact on your behalf.\nFew ringers now use paper and pen to make requests but rely instead on telephone or email. Email is to be recommended as it provides a record of the request and replies. N.B. the tower contact may not have an email address in which case telephone or letter may be necessary. If using a letter ensure that a stamped address envelope is enclosed for the reply.\nThe request should include:\nThe full name of the tower that you wish to ring at, this avoids confusion; there may be more than one tower in a particular location or the contact may be responsible for more than one tower. The date and timings (start and end) of the proposed visit. The name of the group that is requesting to ring; this may be a tower, an established group or a group of friends. It can be useful to include the potential number of ringers. The name of the person making the request. It is advisable to request:\nWhat the access arrangements are; the meeting place might not be the main entrance to the building. If driving, whether there is designated or recommended parking. A contact telephone number, ideally a mobile telephone number, as contact might need to be made on the day. N.B. The person meeting may not be the original contact. Whether a toilet is readily available. If your visit is to coincide with a refreshment break, local recommendations of venues may be helpful. Confirm the arrangements with the various twoer contacts a few days before.\nIt is advisable for more than one person to have the contact details as the organiser may be delayed.\nFigure 4: New Romney, Kent\nDonations # Decide on the amount to be given, as a donation, to each tower. Some groups give a donation proportionate to the number of bells whilst others give the same amount to all towers. It is an individual decision as to which to adopt.\nIt may be that towers request a specific donation when they are contacted. Be aware that this might be greater than that which was planned.\nIt is best to calculate the price per head, and collect that amount, prior to the outing. This reduces the amount of administration on the day. It also allows the right amount to be readily available at each tower.\nDelegate # Once the outing is organised, consider delegating tasks to participants. This might include - producing thank you cards for the towers, collecting and collating tower donations.\nOn Tour # Figure 5: Lydd, Kent\nInform # All those on the outing should be kept informed of the relevant arrangements. A clear, precise and readily available guide is essential. This can be printed (possibly rarer these days) or provided electroncally.\nIt can be useful, especially when travelling individually, to have mobile contact details of the particpants. It might be useful to set up a communication group using a mobile telephone app, such as WhatsApp. It can be useful if there are any changes on the day e.g. a road blockage. This will require the participants to opt in.\nRelax # The organiser should be able to enjoy the ringing and relax like any member of the party.\nConsider delgating the organising of the ringing at each tower. A seperate person per tower will spread the workload. It can give people who might not often get the chance, an opportunity to run the ringing.\nREMEMBER\nthe towers and beels being visited are the property of others (normally churches) so respect this. despite all efforts to ensure a smooth operation, the organiser may need to intervene.
