&lt;p>Prayers are probably only relevant if the tower is part of a religious institution. If it is and a member of the clergy is present, they will perform this and may chair the meeting. If the chair is from the [tower authority](&lt;a href="https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/glossary/#tower">https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/glossary/#tower&lt;/a> authority), and possibly not a ringer, they may provide feedback on a more public basis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Appointment of Tower Captain</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/towercaptain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/towercaptain/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="appointment-of-bell-ringing-tower-captain---a-guide-for-bell-ringers-and-churches">

 Introduction

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This note offers advice to ringers and churches about the appointment of the ‘Tower Captain’ in a church with bells. The person appointed may not be called the ‘Tower Captain’ in all towers – ‘Ringing Master’ is another title that is often used, or that may be used for another person with different responsibilities. In this note, the words ‘Tower Captain’ will be used even if local terminology is different from this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planning ringing</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/planning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/planning/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="planning-ringing">

&lt;blockquote class="book-hint info">
 &lt;p>&lt;strong>REMEMBER&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Not all ringers will arrive on time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow for greeting, hanging up coats, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bells may have to be raised and lowered which may take up to 15 minutes and reduce the time to achieve aims.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aim to give everyone at least one piece of useful and satisfying ringing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Approximate timings of touches (used here to mean any piece of ringing):
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>120 changes of Doubles or Minor takes 4-5 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4-5 minutes is a suitable time for rounds and call changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On 8, or more, pieces will generally be longer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow 2-3 minutes to change over between pieces.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="plan-ahead">
 Plan Ahead
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#plan-ahead">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To get the most out of the time available plan at least one touch ahead. This should reduce gaps between touches and allow more ringing time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Organising an Outing</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/outing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/buildingateam/outing/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="organising-an-outing">

&lt;p>A ringing outing can be an enjoyable and useful way of introducing ringers to a wider variety of bells than they might otherwise encounter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can help those involved to improve bell control and ringing skills, as it is like having multiple practices in one day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most importantly, it is a very good way of getting the ringers together socially.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
