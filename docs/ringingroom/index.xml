&lt;p>Ringing boxes are one of the ubiquitous but often despised necessities of ringing. They are often heavy, they take up space in a ringing room which, in most cases, has little enough space to begin with and many ringers don&amp;rsquo;t like using them anyway.

&lt;p>Lighting in and around a tower is often taken for granted until it is not working!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a consequence of significant technical developments in lighting in the last few years, most people now benefit from good quality artificial light in their domestic, leisure and professional environments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Handbells</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/ringingroom/handbells/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/ringingroom/handbells/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="handbells">
