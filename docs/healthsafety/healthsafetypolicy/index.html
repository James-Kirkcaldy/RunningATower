  Advice for Bell Ringers

This document aims to help bell ringing societies/guilds/associations prepare a Health and Safety Policy for all activities of the society. (In these notes, the word society’ will be used regardless of the title of the society, guild or association concerned.)
Under common law, voluntary organisations and individual volunteers have a ‘duty of care’ to each other and to those who may be affected by their activities. It is therefore good practice for a society to have a written Health and Safety Policy. Some insurers, for example, may ask for evidence of how a society considers Health and Safety matters. These notes will consider only societies with no paid employees. (Note that the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 requires businesses employing 5 or more people to prepare a written Health and Safety Policy. Outside England and Wales, other laws and terminology may be applicable.)"><meta name=theme-color content="#FFFFFF"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/healthsafetypolicy/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Running a Tower"><meta property="og:title" content="Health & Safety Policy"><meta property="og:description" content=" Health & Safety # The following was previously published as a .pdf file on the CCCBR website.
