 Advice for Bell Ringers
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#advice-for-bell-ringers">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This document aims to help bell ringing societies/guilds/associations prepare a Health and Safety Policy for all activities of the society. (In these notes, the word society’ will be used regardless of the title of the society, guild or association concerned.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under common law, voluntary organisations and individual volunteers have a ‘duty of care’ to each other and to those who may be affected by their activities. It is therefore good practice for a society to have a written Health and Safety Policy. Some insurers, for example, may ask for evidence of how a society considers Health and Safety matters. These notes will consider only societies with no paid employees. (Note that the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 requires businesses employing 5 or more people to prepare a written Health and Safety Policy. Outside England and Wales, other laws and terminology may be applicable.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Risk Assessment</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/riskassessment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/riskassessment/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="risk-assessment-guidance">

&lt;p>Most towers with rings of bells are within the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href="https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/glossary/#church-of-england">Church of England&lt;/a>. While that is the focus of this document, the principles apply to rings of bells in towers owned by other organisations, in churches of other denominations, and churches elsewhere in the world. Local legislation and circumstances should always be considered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Risk Assessment extended</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/riskassessmentextended/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/riskassessmentextended/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="risk-assessment-guidance-where-the-bells-have-not-been-rung-for-an-extended-period">

 Introduction
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These notes offer advice about issues to consider in a health and safety risk assessment of the bells and tower prior to the bells being rung after an extended period (several months or more) during which they have not been rung.
This could concern a single bell, manual chimes or change ringing bells.
The notes were first compiled to aid ringers to return to towers to ring bells when restrictions due to Covid-19 were eased, but are applicable after other periods of non-use for whatever reason.
The notes may assist the &lt;a href="https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/glossary/#tower-authority">tower authority&lt;/a> and bell ringers; they do not intend to provide comprehensive information about health and safety or risk assessments generally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fire Protection</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/fireprevention/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/fireprevention/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="fire-protection-and-risk-assessment">

&lt;p>These notes offer advice about specific issues that may affect bell ringers and the bell tower when considering fire safety and fire protection. The notes may assist the &lt;a href="https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/glossary/#tower-authority">tower authority&lt;/a> and bell ringers; they do not intend to provide comprehensive information about fire protection and fire risk assessments more generally. Few towers were designed or built to comply with current legislation and many are extremely historic and vulnerable structures. Ringers are often in towers at times when the building is otherwise unoccupied, and also in parts of the building that are separate and less accessible from the rest of the building.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/security/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="security-of-towers-and-bell-ringers">

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These notes are written to help bell ringers consider their own security and that of the towers that they occupy when ringing. The principles underlying these notes apply to many buildings regardless of function or ownership, and activities. Here we highlight factors that relate specifically to ringers and ringing, rather than those that are more generic. References are drawn from those defined for the &lt;a href="https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/glossary/#church-of-england">Church of England&lt;/a> and the UK. Two main topics are included: Crime and Terrorism&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tower Access</title><link>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/toweraccess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/docs/healthsafety/toweraccess/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="tower-access">

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No matter how comfortable and well equipped your ringing room or how excellent the go of the bells, if you can&amp;rsquo;t reach them safely they&amp;rsquo;re not much use to you. For that reason it is well worth considering the state of the access route to the tower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All towers are different and each will present a corresponding set of unique circumstances which will affect the decisions made with regard to the access route. The access to the tower is not, of course, the sole province of the ringers but of church-wardens, electricians, bell hangers, masons and sometimes visiting members of the public. As such it is necessary to bear in mind the needs of all users of the tower and to remember that access to the upper reaches of the tower should be as well maintained and as carefully designed as the access to the ringing room.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
