### Weddings 

In the Church of England, the fees for wedding ringing are set by the PCC, hopefully in consultation with the ringers. These should reflect whether ringing is: 

- Before and / or after the wedding. 

- The length of the ringing. 

- The number of bells. 

- Likely travel times and distances, etc. 

The couple should be advised that ringing may not continue until the bride arrives if she is excessively late.  

## Fees for other ringing 

Consider having fixed fees for: 

- Visiting bands  

- Quarter peals 

- Peals 

These may be determined in consultation with the tower authority.  

Subscriptions, to tower and local society. 

## Payment of Fees 

Arrangements must also be made for how the ringers receive the money. In the Church of England, it is likely that the couple pay all the costs at one time and the church then pass the money to the recipient groups. With the reduction in use of cash, the church may expect to do this via bank transfer. 

 

Electronic donation (Alison Hodge) 

Consider having an electronic payment system for fees and casual donations.  Avoid having a 'box on the wall', especially for downstairs rings, as these will invite theft and damage. 

Add request for Gift Aid – enables tax to be reclaimed 

## Expenditure 

Agree with the tower authority and agree in advance who will pay for replaceable items e.g., ropes. 

If a major project is envisaged the funding of this must be agreed in consultation with the tower authority. A separate document covers the running of a project. Insert link to that document 

## Tower Funds 

Towers sometimes have funds separate from the tower authority. These traditionally have been used for minor repairs and social events for ringers. Such funds are not advisable and money should not be held by individuals.  

If essential, specific treasurer’s accounts are available and may be free from fees. Banks are increasingly reluctant to having small society accounts.  If lodging money with the PCC ensure that this is in a RESTRICTED fund designated for use only on the bells and associated installation. This should prevent the funds being diverted to other church projects. 

## VAT and the LPW (Listed Places of Worship) VAT recovery scheme 

This allows VAT on certain maintenance costs to be reclaimed where the church is listed. This would normally apply to ropes purchased by the PCC (even if reimbursed by a separate ringers' fund) but not if purchased by a separate ringers' organisation.
